Me: **""FLOOR!""**

Long story short we did our best to reverse engineer the hand and give everyone their money back. Changed the deck and triple checked the rundown."

**Bicycle races:** 

I *know* that my legs are stronger than anyone else in this race. I *know* that I'm a better bike handler than anyone else in this race.

Statistically, I should win.

I have $1000 for three (3) races this weekend in which I've invested $333.33 per race against complete amateurs.

If I stay safe,pick my spots carefully and race like a seasoned racer -- I'll should win. 

If I get too close to the back wheel of an amateur who doesn't know what they're doing -- I could get my front wheel clipped and crash hard... injured to the point where I can't continue for the next two races.

It's best to give up that stage of the race and pick a better spot to win on the next stage of the race -- when the 'wheel-clipper' is at the back of the peleton. . 

**Poker games:**

I *know* that I'm better than everyone else in this game. I *know* that I have more patience than everyone else in this game.

I have $1000 for three (3) games this weekend in which I've invested $333.33 per game against idiots. 

If I stay safe and play like a seasoned player -- I'll should win.

If I start calling-down an amateur who is trying to prove themselves -- I could get my whole stack taken. 

It's best to fold and take advantage of their bravado the next hand.

**Bicycle races:** 

I *know* that my legs are stronger than anyone else in this race. I *know* that I'm a better bike handler than anyone else in this race.

Statistically, I should win.

I have $1000 for three (3) races this weekend in which I've invested $333.33 per race against complete amateurs.

If I stay safe,pick my spots carefully and race like a seasoned racer -- I'll should win. 

If I get too close to the back wheel of an amateur who doesn't know what they're doing -- I could get my front wheel clipped and crash hard... injured to the point where I can't continue for the next two races.

It's best to give up that stage of the race and pick a better spot to win on the next stage of the race -- when the 'wheel-clipper' is at the back of the peleton. . 

**Poker games:**

I *know* that I'm better than everyone else in this game. I *know* that I have more patience than everyone else in this game.

I have $1000 for three (3) games this weekend in which I've invested $333.33 per game against idiots. 

If I stay safe and play like a seasoned player -- I'll should win.

If I start calling-down an amateur who is trying to prove themselves -- I could get my whole stack taken. 

It's best to fold and take advantage of their bravado the next hand.

ChatGPT: Understood. Let's proceed with the ante of 2 chips each, bringing the total pot to 4 chips. Since I dealt the last hand, you'll be the first to act this time.

Here are your five cards for this hand:

1. \[9♦\] (9 of Diamonds)
2. \[7♠\] (7 of Spades)
3. \[J♦\] (Jack of Diamonds)
4. \[6♣\] (6 of Clubs)
5. \[3♠\] (3 of Spades)

Would you like to check, bet, or fold?

📷**You:** Check.

&#x200B;

**ChatGPT:** Since you've checked, I'll check as well. No bets are made, so let's proceed to the next stage.

Here's the final hand:

Your hand:

* \[9♦\] \[7♠\] \[J♦\] \[6♣\] \[3♠\]

My hand remains undisclosed for now.

Shall we reveal our hands and determine the winner?

📷**You:** Check.  


**ChatGPT**: Understood, we both check. Let's reveal our hands:

Your hand:

* \[9♦\] \[7♠\] \[J♦\] \[6♣\] \[3♠\]

My hand:

* \[A♠\] \[K♠\] \[Q♠\] \[J♠\] \[10♠\]

It looks like I have a flush with all spades, which beats your high card Jack. Therefore, I win this hand.

Since we both checked, there are no chips bet or won in this hand.

Would you like to continue playing, or is there anything else I can assist you with?  


📷**You:** You got a Royal Flush in 5 Card Stud you motherfucker!  


**ChatGPT:** I apologize for the confusion. It appears there was a misunderstanding regarding the game being played. I appreciate your patience and understanding. Let's clarify the game format.

In 5-card stud, players are dealt five cards with betting rounds interspersed between each deal. There are no community cards as in Texas Hold'em. Given this format, a royal flush would indeed be an incredibly rare and fortunate hand.

Thank you for bringing this to my attention. If you'd like to continue playing or if there's anything else I can assist you with, please let me know.

📷**You:** I'll deal the next hand. I don't trust you. "

I suspect there's more to the story but he wouldn't budge. Clearly, I wasn't keen on pressing him for more information."

I stay completely sober and take my Gabapentin to ensure that I don't have a gran mal seizure and traumatize my entire family.  


The problem is that the Gabapentin gives me double vision so I'm always closing one eye to see or feeling in front of me to make sure I don't run into a door frame or something.  


These actions make my family think that I'm shitfaced when I'm being respectful to them by staying completely sober.  


Anyone else have issues like this?"

I'm a mod of /r/bicycling. 

Hello.

I'm new in OKC. I just moved here from NYC where I mod /r/NYCbike. I'd like to get us (OKC) on the /r/bicycling sidebar map.

We (/r/bicycling) have a rule that each local bicycling community must have 50 subscribers to be placed on the map. Even as an all powerful mod I can't break the rule.

I created /r/OKCbike quite a while ago but we need a few more subscribers to be put on the map in /r/bicycling, the main bicycling subreddit. So, if you like to ride bikes and/or want to read/share information about all things OKC biking related, join/organize group rides, etc. -- please feel free to subscribe to /r/OKCbike. 

**TL;DR -- Subscribe to /r/OKCbike right now. Thank you.**"

Some of the other large'ish subs which I moderate will be participating in the blackout. It's a tough call to make, no doubt.

I feel that to blackout /r/StandUpShots would be working against the premise of the sub. Furthermore -- If a good portion of the larger subs are blacked out then this sub will receive a residual traffic increase which works heavily in the favor of the nature of this subreddit -- the nature being self promotion.

All of that said -- I encourage all standup comedians to double down on their submissions during the blackout."

My Santee gave me nothing to go on besides a few Reddit comments which are, well, not encouraging. 

Upon 'stalking' my person a little further, all I could find was that he appears to be an at-risk low-income urban teenager. He is disrespectful, bitter and thinks the world holds no hope for him. Also, he is mildly interested in creative writing.

I sent him a cheerful anonymous email in an effort to allow him to tell me something about himself so that I can tailor a gift for him. To put it mildly, the email exchange did not go well and it ended with him telling me that whatever I got for him would be thrown away without being opened. He's a real sweetheart. :\

Not easily deterred, his horrid attitude motivated me even more to get him something amazing.

Instead of buying him a book about creative writing for young writers and a nice pen, I started thinking much much bigger.

I researched the town he lives in and then searched further for any notable writers who live in that town and who might be willing to volunteer an hour of their time to meet with the young man and talk to him about life, writing, whatever. Maybe I could convince a local college professor to invite the kid to sit in on a first-year writing class and give him some personal attention... you get the idea. 

What I found is that a certain rapper/musican grew up in my giftee's hometown and went to the same high school as the kid I'm getting a gift for. Not only that, this rapper/musican has a non-profit arts center devoted to encouraging at-risk youths to stay positive and foster their creativity.

I wrote an email to the artist's management and affiliated charity and, well, it is *confirmed* that my giftee is going to receive a personalized and autographed photo of his hometown hero, who is most likely pretty busy right now with his 6 Grammy nominations. 
[hint](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taboo_%28rapper%29)

I've been working on this for a while and haven't said anything about it just in case it fell through. It's been killing me. Now that it's in concrete, I couldn't help but tell you folks about it. 

I wish I could see the look on his face when he opens it (if he doesn't throw it away, first)!

HAPPY HOLIDAYS EVERYONE!

edit: All credit goes to  **[this inspiring foundation](http://peapod.dipdive.com/biography/)** for making it happen. All I did was write an email.

edit2: Almost forgot. I also sent him a [Salad Fingers journal](http://www.cafepress.com/+salad-fingers+journals), a [small button](http://www.cafepress.com/+protagonist_mini_button,291784474) that says ""protagonist"" which he can put on his hoodie or whatever the teenagers wear these days, and [a magnet](http://www.cafepress.com/+only_human_rectangle_magnet,352125403) that says ""human"" with a barcode.

My father is a financial planner and has been hiding/stealing money from me for a couple decades -- it's stock which I was gifted from my grandfather and inheritance from his death. Also, a substantial class action settlement payment which he reinvested into ""my"" portfolio.

I recently filed a proper change of address with the post office so the statements are now being mailed (mail forwarding) to me instead of my father. This is how I became aware of what's happening.

My father is listed as the ""representative"" on the account which happens to hold the money -- and he works for said company.

**My question is this:**

**How do I go about liquidating said money without my father knowing that I'm doing it?**"

I am a staunch atheist.


I can’t have a normal, civil conversation with my father without coming to an impasse. I believe that this is due to my father's inability to speak about anything for more than two seconds without making a reference to god. 


My father knows that  I don’t believe in a god yet he relentlessly reduces every point of discussion to a matter of faith. I try to explain to my dad that the only reason he is a Christian is that he was born into it.

He responded, ""It's not a matter of chance, son. God birthed you where you were birthed for a reason. God knows who the good Christians will be and makes them born in America. As Americans, it's our job to spread the word of Jesus to the terrorists.""

WTF?

Is there any possible way for me to speak with my father without being perceived as using my alleged ""quick tongue""? Apparently a ""quick tongue"", otherwise known in my reality as ""someone who knows what the fuck they are talking about"" doesn't hold any weight in my father's world and is in fact the work of the devil. 

Seems hopeless.

EDIT: This is an adult conversation. My father is ~60 and I am ~30. As an only child, a meeting of the minds is becoming increasingly critical. "

However, I am aware that these fees apply to me as per the TOS of Citibank. As the overdraft was definitely my fault, I normally would have chalked up the loss.

However, considering the $300B bailout that Citibank received, I found it appalling that not only would I be paying taxes for the rest of my life to recoup Citibank's losses but I found it vomit-inducing that they would also charge me $34 for overdrafting my account by $4. 

I decided to call them and try to play this angle it an attempt to get the overdraft charge refunded to me. 

Long story short: They phone rep didn't even give me a chance to play the card. With very little argument, the phone rep refunded the charge to me within 3 minutes... even though I acknowledged that the overdraft was clearly my fault. 

I was actually rather disappointed that I didn't get to use my trump card as I really wanted to see how that would have played out.

I am confused about my feelings."

Today, I received a letter from David A. Paterson, Governor of New York on behalf of the New York State Department of Labor. The letter, in part, reads:

*""I am pleased to inform you of a new opportunity to receive federal student financial assistance for education and training. On May 8th, President Obama announced that individuals receiving unemployment insurance benefits will be given special consideration for Pell Grants and other forms of federal student aid for education [...] Pell Grants cover up to $5,350 in education expenses, and are accepted at nearly all universities and community colleges [...] The President also encourages states to allow unemployment recipients to continue to collect benefits while enrolled in state approved training, something New York already does.""*

This got me thinking. **Would Reddit consider sponsoring a cycling team/club?**

Reddit could print jerseys and offset the cost to its cycling team/club members to compensate for advertising value, etc. Reddit could monetize this in so many ways. 

What do you guys think? Do you have any ideas?

edit: If we can confirm 10 riders we can get a group VIP deal. 

edit2*: Regarding jerseys: How awesome would it be to have your buddy ride up behind you and insert a granola bar into one of your three orangered-envelope pockets? "

I know nothing about Seattle and I'm hoping /r/Seattle can help me.

My travel partner and I like nice restaurants, nightlife, dive bars, arts culture, sight seeing, etc. 

I'd like to experience Seattle like a local. I'm less interested in the typical touristy stuff.

I want to stay in a nice'ish hotel in a hip part of town that's pedestrian friendly, as I won't have a car. How is the public transportations system in Seattle? Can I get by without a car?

Any suggestions?

Thanks in advance, Seattle!

*addition: 

I like bars that have games (pool, darts, shuffle board, foosball, etc.) I don't really like crowded bars. I prefer empty little known gems where the regular neighborhood characters hang out. If there's a place to drink beer and play serious ping-pong I would cream myself.

I like live music of all sorts. I do not like dance clubs."

This is the same person who, after being cured of a serious illness, will thank god and not recognize the doctors or the science that brings us modern medicine. This is the same person who, when receiving a promotion or a raise at their job, will thank god and not recognize their own hard work and achievements. This is the same person who claims that god gave him this land therefore he is completely justified in committing acts of unspeakable violence against his neighbors. This is the same 40-year-old Yemeni man who watches his pregnant 12-year-old wife bleed to death over the course of 3 days while attempting to give birth because she can’t receive the necessary medical attention because she can’t be seen naked by another man, lest she be put to death according to religious dogma.

I was checking over the set of  our production of ""Little Shop of Horrors"" just before hundreds of elementary school students were due to arrive at our school to watch our show. This was just a few days after my 15th birthday.

--**BOOM**--

Everyone suspected that the boiler or the new AC units had exploded. It's the only thing that made sense at the time. 

A few minutes later, the principal's voice came over the intercom. His voice sounded different than usual. What was usually an upbeat and cheerful voice was now flat, robotic, terrified and on the verge of tears.  

*""Teachers, please release all students who have family working in or around the Murrah Federal Building to meet in the auditorium immediately. Everyone else, please stay put. Thank you"".*

At least a third of the thousand-or-so students shuffled to the auditorium, confused. I was also confused because I was already in the auditorium where we expecting several hundred children to arrive in just a few minutes... and my father works a block away from the Murrah Building. 

The principal told the students in the auditorium what had happened. We were told that we could use the resources in the school's office to try to contact our families. Most everyone decided to leave school and either go downtown or go home to contact their families. No one was going to stop us. The older kids crammed in as many underclassmen as they could into their cars to take them wherever they needed to go.

The other kids who were still in the classrooms figured out very quickly that something was horribly wrong when the kids from the auditorium came back into the classrooms to retrieve their belongs, many of them in absolute hysterics and some shell shocked. Word spread very quickly about what had happened. My pager, which I wasn't supposed to have in school, went off displaying my father's 'code' so I knew he was okay.  This was before every kid had a cellphone.

The bus loads of children were turned away when they arrived to see the show. Half the cast and crew had already left the building, myself included. I don't know how the administrators handled turning the buses away and if they broke the news to them right then and there. It would interesting to know in retrospect. 

A friend of mine and I walked to ground zero and helped bring water to the rescue crews.

I will never forget that day. "

We just got the official green light from our Reddit overlords to move forward with the Reddit cycling jersey.

I need to get a general idea of how many jerseys we should plan to order.  

Below is a general idea of the design. We hope to have a properly vectored model within a few days:

* The color scheme of the panels of the jersey will be white and sky blue with black trim as to reflect the design of Reddit: http://imgur.com/faDi8.jpg or the [inverse](http://imgur.com/Rpa6h.jpg).

* The front of the jersey will be printed with the 'reddit' text logo or something like this: http://imgur.com/JDSwL.png

* The back of of jersey will display the reddit alien w/ text logo underneath (not pictured): http://imgur.com/19Z4n.jpg

* The side panels will feature vertically mirrored Reddit Evolution images: http://imgur.com/FBoRc.jpg

* Shoulders will display the 'Reddit Coat of Arms' (or sponsors): http://imgur.com/sNLKv.png

* THE BEST PART -- We want orangered envelopes printed on the rear jersey pockets. [This image](http://imgur.com/T4esr.png) or [this image](http://imgur.com/E96Q9.png)

This is just a preliminary step to see who's interested. This is not necessarily a final design. 

Let it be known if you're interested!

*edit: For those asking about price: We don't know yet. It depends on the quality, quantity and potential sponsorships of the jerseys that Redditors want to buy. Figure $50-$100. "

I payed for my beer and the cashier gave me too much change. I told the cashier that he had given me too much change and I returned to him the extra money.

One of the few things which will instantly change my mood from 'happy' to 'murderous', skipping every step in between, is when someone in a car passes me waaay to closely. I completely lose my mind.

This morning, I woke up to a beautiful day and immediately grabbed the bike and ran outside,  -- skipping breakfast and everything else. I was *so* jazzed to get in a good ride.

Not five minutes after hitting the road, a minivan passed me about four inches to my left. It took half-a-second for my blood to boil and I gave the side of the minivan a good slap with my left hand to let him know that I didn't appreciate it *at all*... and also to frighten him into thinking he may have hit me. The van continued on. 

The next car in traffic, a sedan, pulls up beside me and the driver rolls down the passenger side window and screams at me ""Get off the fucking road! Punch *my* car and see what happens!""

So, I punched his car and took off like a rocket (I live in NYC, there's no way a car can catch me on my bike). I'm not necessarily proud of my actions and the whole incident ruined my ride.

How do you deal with motorists who pass you waaay too closely?... or actually swipe you?

I know absolutely nothing about nutrition and how the body processes different types of food.

I usually don't feel like eating in the morning before I go on a ride. I usually ride about 15-20 miles and then stop somewhere to eat, and then I don't feel like eating and usually just get a beer instead. Then I ride back another 15-20 miles and eat a meal when I get home.

I know this isn't ideal and it's hurting my body and my performance. 

If I ever eat before a morning ride, it's usually a banana/kiwi/strawberry/protein-powder smoothie which I make in my blender. Is this sufficient?

What do you eat/drink before a morning ride?

The wind in NYC today was *vicious*. We rounded a corner somewhere in Greenpoint where we unknowingly entered a sick, twisted and sadistic crosswind tunnel.

I've been cycling for 25 years and I know how to lean and turn into a crosswind but this was an entirely different story. The wind came on so fast and strong that I instinctually unclipped from the pedals because I thought I was going to be blown off my bike, literally.

Long story short. It blew us both straight off the side of the road, no questions asked. We were lucky to stay upright. It was by far the strangest feeling I've ever had on a bicycle.

Has this happened to anyone else? Has anyone actually been blown off their bike? 

*aside: To give you an idea of how strong the wind was... it was picking up large gravel from the street and hurling in through the air fast enough take your eye out. I grew up in Oklahoma, ""Tornado Alley"", and I've never seen anything like this."

Hi BikeIt!

Just a heads-up...

We've received the green light to move forward with the second round of reddit Cycling Jerseys. We plan to have  the online store open by Wednesday of next week, possibly earlier. Keep your eyes peeled for an official release post right here in /r/bicycling. We're excited about getting things moving!

Thanks everyone! Have a great weekend!

The [online store](http://sites.google.com/site/pandasonic/) is now open!

The design is inked and the printing presses are set. We are proud to announce that we are now taking orders for The Second Generation of the **The Unofficial Official reddit Cycling Jersey** and the all new **reddit Evolution Arm Warmers**!

The long-sleeved jerseys and fleece arm warmers, being produced by Champion Systems, are available at our [Google Checkout Store](http://sites.google.com/site/pandasonic/). Jerseys are available in both men’s and women’s sizes and club and race cuts. Hooray choices! Rumor is, a certain reddit admin has his eye on a pair of arm warmers to keep himself warm in the stands during football season.
We will be taking orders for the next two (2) weeks ONLY. Ordering closes at midnight, PST on 8/18/2010.

As an added bonus, reddit has generously offered to include a [reddit Evolution Poster]( http://store.xkcd.com/reddit/#redditalienevolutionposter) with the first ten (10) orders and [exclusive reddit sticker(s)](http://i.imgur.com/Vovls.jpg) with each and every order for the first one-hundred (100) orders. Thanks reddit!

Please see the [order page](http://sites.google.com/site/pandasonic/) for all the details and please be extra aware: **It will take three (3) months from the time your gear is ordered until it is delivered to your door.**

Questions? Please check out the [order page](http://sites.google.com/site/pandasonic/) first to see if the information you need is there!

I stayed out partying with some buddies the night before into the wee hours of the morning. 

I figured that it wouldn't really be a problem for me to lead some non-cyclists around the outer boroughs for ~30 miles at a snail's pace after a night of drinking and relatively no sleep. 

I couldn't have been more wrong and I embarrassed myself greatly in front of long time family friends.

At about the 10 mile mark, I bonked hard. I started throwing up the water that I'd tanked, while riding. Heave after heave of water. I never got off the bike. To avoid embarrassment, I made it look like I was swigging water from my bottle and spitting it out. 

I tried tanking water again, still on the bike, to try and mitigate the damage. Didn't work. At all. Everything I put in came right back out immediately and made the vomiting worse. At this point, I couldn't hide it anymore. I was heaving repeatedly until there was nothing left. And then heaving some more. Nonstop. Still on the bike.

The people I was with realized something was very wrong. 

Without any notice or explanation, I bunny hopped my racing bike up the curb and towards the closest shade tree I could find and laid myself over on the grass. I didn't even bother to unclip. Just laid over in the cool grass and heaved and heaved. 

The people I was with were all starting to freak out a bit. I kept telling them to relax and enjoy their vacation and give me 10 minutes to lie down, drink some water and close my eyes briefly.

Awkward.

I rested for a few minutes, got back to my feet, faked my best smile and said, ""Okay! You guys ready?"" This happened two more times. One of the people with me, a nurse, insisted upon calling an ambulance because she was positive that I was in major trouble. She was probably right. All the while, I'm insisting that I was fine.

I managed to last until we got to a park within a couple blocks of a subway and I headed for a shade tree again and called it quits. My entire body had locked up and I couldn't move or think straight. At all. In short bursts between panting and heaving, I told my guests that I was going to take a nap for a couple hours and they should just move on without me so they could make their dinner reservations. 

They put up a good fight but I convinced them that I was fine and just needed to rest. I slept for two hours on the grass in Washington Square Park with a growing pile of regurgitated water and Gatorade next to my head. When I woke up, I was able to finish my bottle of Gatorade (slowly) and walk my bike two blocks to the subway. I had to sit down three times in two blocks so I didn't faint. Thankfully, I got a seat on the subway. I didn't know what I was going to do if I had to stand. 

I got home safely but not by enough of a margin. I remember opening the door to my apartment and having serious doubts if I would make to my bed without collapsing.

I have never experienced anything like this and I don't ever want to again. It was horrible.

TL;DR: Don't stay up all night drinking and think you can ride in the heat the next day, no matter how easy the ride or no matter how much water you tank before the ride or on the bike. Doesn't work very well."

They arrested him on the street and cuffed his hands behind his back. When they went to put him in the car, he jerked away and ran.

It's impossible to explain the power, speed and grace of this man as he sprinted down the middle of the street and hurdled car hoods with his hands cuffed behind his back. I've never seen anything like it. 

After asking around a bit, I've learned that this guy had recently attended but had been cut from an NFL camp.

If this guy can outrun the cops while handcuffed and got rejected for the NFL, think about what the stars of the NFL are capable of.

Maybe you had to be there.

",/r/washingtondc/comments/dlsqs/we_need_your_help_rwashingtondc_big_idea_local/,"Hi /r/Washington/DC!

Thanks so much for all your hospitality and help to host redditors in your lovely town. Your willingness to provide redditors with couches, rides and answers to their mundane questions is greatly appreciated! 

That said, we need you to go a bit further. Allow me to explain.

A [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/ColbertRally/comments/dlpi0/what_if_we_somehow_got_local_dc_businesses_to/) popped up in /r/ColbertRally asking if any DC businesses might want to offer discounts to redditors attending the rally. I think this is a *fanstastic* idea for local DC business owners and redditors alike. It's a win-win.

Though, as good of an idea as this is, we don't think it's the type of thing that reddit's sales/marketing folks would do best. This is where *you* come in. 

Do you guys know any business owners or do you frequent any businesses which might be interested in this? User [danielem1](http://www.reddit.com/user/danielem1) can place said business on the [Official reddit Rally & Event Map](http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=105005923247522005105.000490f76295d626fa5b6&ll=38.902923,-77.022572&spn=0.065058,0.154324&z=13) which redditors can check in real time and meet each other, while providing substantial business.

User 'turlz' put it well [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ColbertRally/comments/dlpi0/what_if_we_somehow_got_local_dc_businesses_to/c114sqr): Paraphrase -- ""If two coffee shops are next to each other and one has a reddit alien tape-up in the window offering a discount with a huge crowd outside, drawing attention... who's going to get the business?""

Let us know what you guys think. This would be beneficial to everyone!"

The [online store](http://sites.google.com/site/pandasonic/) is now open!

The design is inked and the printing presses are set. We are proud to announce that we are now taking orders for The Second Generation of the **The Unofficial Official reddit Cycling Jersey** and the all new **reddit Evolution Arm Warmers**!

The long-sleeved jerseys and fleece arm warmers, being produced by Champion Systems, are available at our [Google Checkout Store](http://sites.google.com/site/pandasonic/). Jerseys are available in both men’s and women’s sizes and club and race cuts. Hooray choices! Rumor is, a certain reddit admin has his eye on a pair of arm warmers to keep himself warm in the stands during football season.
We will be taking orders for the next two (2) weeks ONLY. Ordering closes on 8/18/10.

As an added bonus, reddit has generously offered to include a [reddit Evolution Poster]( http://store.xkcd.com/reddit/#redditalienevolutionposter) with the first ten (10) orders and exclusive reddit sticker(s) with each and every order for the first one-hundred (100) orders. Thanks reddit!
Please see the [order page](http://sites.google.com/site/pandasonic/) for all the details and please be extra aware: **It will take three (3) months from the time your gear is ordered until it is delivered to your door.**

Questions? Please check out the [order page](http://sites.google.com/site/pandasonic/) first to see if the information you need is there!

Here's the lowdown. 

According to a reliable source:

**EVENTS:**

There will be an Official reddit Event on Friday afternoon/evening in DC. (no details yet and no guarantees)

The Colbert Rally will be from 9a-5p on Saturday and will be a ""march"".

The Stewart Rally will be from 12p-3p on Saturday.

Both rallies will intersect at some point and hilarity will ensue. 

Redditors from near and far will party in DC all of Saturday night. 

**TRANSPORTATION:**

*""Unofficial Official NYC reddit Party Bus""*: Several redditors have already booked bus tickets to DC on the following [BoltBus](https://www.boltbus.com/). It's gonna be a party:

* Route:New York 33rd and 7th by Sbarro (To DC or Balt.) to Washington (Union Station), DC

* Date:10/29/2010

* Departs:11:30 AM

* Arrives:3:45 PM

* $40-$50 round-trip

*BoltBus* has WiFi and will let you bring your bike on the bus if you want to avoid the inevitably crowded DC Metro.

Someone has a Facebook page setup [here](http://www.facebook.com/pages/NYC-Restoring-Truthiness-DC-Bus-Trip/145200228855078) to organize a bus trip but it's not going anywhere and I think we can do better right here.

Carpools: redditors are arranging carpools here: http://www.reddit.com/r/RedditCarpool/ but feel free to discuss in the comments here if you find it more convenient. 

Amtrak: A little faster, a lot more expensive... and no WiFi.

**LODGING:**

I just booked a hotel for two (2) nights in Georgetown for four (4) redditors and we're only paying ~$60 per person TOTAL for two nights ($30/per night per person).

Feel free to use the comments section in this post to group up and book rooms together if you wish. 

There are also DC area redditors offering couches and such here: http://www.reddit.com/r/sanitycouches

Hope this helps get the ball rolling. 

*oops, almost forgot: Here is the BoltBus that several redditors have already booked for the return trip on Sunday:

* Route:Washington (Union Station), DC to New York 33rd and 7th by Sbarro (To DC or Balt.)

* Date:10/31/2010

* Departs:5:30 PM

* Arrives:9:45 PM


Looking forward to restoring sanity and keeping fear alive!"

I was looking into getting an interactive RoadID but it seems like a whole lot of information stored in one place that can be accessed by anyone if you happen to loose the bracelet somehow. 

Is it better to just carry a laminated list of emergency contacts in your jersey pocket? Would people know to look there?

There seems to be a lot of interest so far so I'm posting here:

>Almost all of the New Year's activities in NYC are uber-expensive and most likely filled to capacity.

>I'm willing to host a party at my apartment. I have a verifiable record of organizing totally sweet reddit events. I have a big apartment with plenty of seating, TV, wi-fi , two bathrooms, coat room, etc. At or around 8:00pm until whenever. 

>I'm steps from the 175th St. stop on the 'A' in Washington Heights. (It's a much faster trip than you may think).

**IMPORTANT: Everybody should bring whatever they want to consume and/or share with others.** I'll provide cups, plates, utensils, etc. There's a liquor store and a bodega on my block. There are several food delivery options (pizza, burgers, chinese, sushi, bbq, dominican, etc.) I'll also have some good munchies available.

**~~Reply here if you're interested. I'll PM you with the specifics.~~** Also, I'll post any updates in the edits below.

Happy New Year!

*edit1: ~~If you reply here and I don't send you the details within a day or two, PM me and let me know.~~

*edit2: I'm hiring a bouncer. His word is final. No one under 18 is allowed to enter. No one under 21 is allowed to drink alcohol.

*edit3: WE'RE FULL. BEYOND FULL. If you've received the details, you're registered. If not, I'm very sorry and enjoy your New Year's Eve! 

**edit4: To those who are registered** -- please *don't* bring more people than for which you have RSVP'd. If you do, it will be embarrassing for both of us. I have a list. If you're not on the list or a *tallied* guest of someone on the list, You Shall Not Pass. If you do manage to pass, I will find out and have you escorted out of my apartment and into the street in humiliating fashion. 
(I'm not really this rigid, I promise. I just have to cover my ass.)

See you on Friday!

P.S. If anyone wants to bring a Kinect or Wii, that might be pretty fun... though I can't guarantee that there will room to move. ;)"

Hi /r/nyc!

I'm hosting a reddit Super Bowl party at my apartment. I have a verifiable record of putting together pretty sweet reddit events -- most recently the [/r/nyc New Year's Eve Party](http://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/esbht/nyc_reddit_new_years_eve_houseparty_details_inside/), /r/nyc Christmas Dinner and the [NYC-DC Rally Bus](http://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/dfsnm/rnyc_official_stewartcolbert_rally_post_events/). 

I can hold 50 redditors maximum and I expect it to fill up fast, really fast.

RSVP in the comments below if you'd like to attend. I will send you the details. It's on a first-come-first-serve basis. If you receive the details from me then you are confirmed.  Friends and significant others are welcome. You can bring a maximum of two (2) human companions and please account for them in your comment below by indicating '+X'. Please do not bring pets unless your pet is a talking parrot because I like talking parrots.

Check out the link above to see how this worked on New Year's Eve. If I don't send you the details within a few days, that probably means that we're full. I will update this post when we've reached capacity. Love you folks.

**What To Bring:** *Bring whatever you want to consume and/or share with others. There is a bodega, a liquor store and several order-in food options on my block. I will provide plates, cups and utensils.*

**What To Expect:** *Expect heavy drinking. Expect smoking. Expect a mix of geeks and football fans (not necessarily mutually exclusive). Expect to be leaving a couple hours after the game is over because I have to work the next morning. Expect to have a damn good time among very friendly redditors who will go out of their way to make sure everyone feels comfortable.*

Hooray, reddit (and also the handegg contest)!"

Greetings /r/nyc! 

This Monday, July 4th, 2011, our beloved country is celebrating her 235th birthday. 

What better way to revel in our cherished independence than with fellow redditors in a setting of Classic Americana? This author can't think of a single one (within reason, anyway). 

As such, **We are set to have a ginormous /r/nyc-wide celebration at Coney Island / Brighton Beach on Monday, this Fourth Of July.**

Upon seeing the smorgasbord of events occurring throughout the day, it is hard to imagine that even the most discretionary of redditors won't be able to find something which tickles their fancy. 

Festivities start at 10am with the Pre-Show of the Nathan's Hotdog Eating Contest. The pre-show features three Ringling Bros. acts and a wide variety of notable, featured musical performers. The hotdog eating contest starts at Noon and is world famous. 

If live music and hotdog eating contests aren't your thing and you'd rather show up later, the possibilities are endless. Enjoy the clean beach while swimming, throwing a frisbee or just laying out and soaking up some sun (we won't make you take your shirt off, stop freaking out, geez). 

Not a beach person? Cool, you can ride insane rides and roller coasters or play midway games at Luna Park. Do rollercoasters make you uneasy? Midway games send you into a rage when you can't knock over those obviously rigged milk bottles? No worries.

Perhaps you would enjoy chillin' out at the NY Aquarium to check out the seals and jellyfish and turtles and shit. This author, for one, [likes turtles](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMNry4PE93Y#t=0m8s). 

All of these amazing prizes can be yours and are within mere steps of one another. All you have to do is bring your beautiful, smiling face to Coney Island / Brighton Beach on Monday, July 4th. 

--*“This sounds great and all but I have to be honest. All I want to do is sit in the shade, stuff my face full of sausages, waffle fries, and funnel cakes (or perhaps something a bit more upscale), and get really drunk with my fellow redditors”*--, you say? Your voice is heard and encouraged. You are not alone and you will be accommodated like you never thought possible. The boardwalk is lined with a wide variety of affordable indoor and outdoor eating and drinking establishments. Take your pick! 

Get excited /r/nyc! This is going to be special. This author has you covered. 

**If you plan to attend, please RSVP on the Meetup post here: http://www.meetup.com/NYC-Redditors/events/23793411/. Much appreciated.**

Unabashedly yours,

SoManyMinutes






*Logistics: Right now, the plan is for a few redditors (not you, don't worry) to stake out a spot on Brighton Beach which will serve as a central hub and meeting location. Everyone can come by, drop off your things and run off to go crazy if you so wish. The beach bums will [watch all the things](http://i.imgur.com/GouWR.png). If you plan on hanging on the beach, make sure to bring what you need. As redditors are the smartest people on the planet, you will be responsible for knowing what those things are. 

*Finding Us: Google Latitude. Several prior meetups in fairly vague locations have proven time and time again that Google Latitude is an invaluable tool for finding people in large spaces. If you do not know other redditors who are on Latitude, you can PM me and add me on Latitude. The rest takes care of itself. If you do not have a smart phone, we will try to update the meetup post with our location as accurately as possible (x paces from y landmark, look right 15 yards). We will try to setup camp close to the boardwalk as to be reasonably visible. 

*All ages welcome... your children included. Just be aware that we are redditors at the end of the day. You might end up playing the “earmuff game” with your little one more often than you wanted to. 

** This author (a mod of /r/bicycling) might be leading a bicycle ride to Coney Island, depending on the level of interest . In order to accommodate redditors in various locations, there will be a couple meetup points for the ride with staggered start times (TBD). The first will most likely be Union Square Park and second, Prospect Park. These rides are about 15 and 10 miles respectively and will be at a moderate pace. You will be responsible for bringing your own lock and any other other necessary equipment (helmet!). Some experience riding in the city is preferred. No first timers, please. (contact me if you're intererested). The bike ride is just an afterthought, only pay attention to this last paragraph if you're specifically interested in riding bikes to Coney Island. 

That's it! This is going to be special! Bring your smiling face. Frowns are welcome, too. We don't judge."

Okay, here is the part where we get serious: You need Google Latitude! Once you get Latitude on your mobile, you also need to add 'Blotner[at]gmail', 'pavel.lishin[at]gmail' and 'RyanCPotts[at]gmail' as we are the beacons for the day. Blotner is handling the first part of the day (hotdog eating contest and pre-show), I am handling the later part of the day (bike ride and other activities) and Pavel and Sarah are setting up base camp on the beach. Feel free to contact any one of us at any time. That's what we're here for.

If you do not have Latitude: You can call Blotner at (412)BLOTNER or me at (336)525-6008 and we will instruct you how to find us or we will come get you. 

If it is not clear yet, Blotner,  is handling the early part of the day (hotdog eating contest and pre-show) Pavel and Sarah are setting up camp on the beach and I will be handling the bike ride and other activities. If you plan on joining the bike ride to Coney Island, it is imperative that you call me at the above number by Sunday evening.

There seems to be a lot of interest so far so I'm posting here:

>Almost all of the New Year's activities in NYC are uber-expensive and most likely filled to capacity.

>I'm willing to host a party at my apartment. I have a verifiable record of organizing totally sweet reddit events. I have a big apartment with plenty of seating, TV, wi-fi , two bathrooms, coat room, etc.

>I'm steps from the 175th St. stop on the 'A' in Washington Heights. (It's a much faster trip than you may think).

As far as what to bring: Everybody should bring whatever they want to consume. I'll provide cups, plates, utensils, etc. There's a liquor store and a bodega on my block. There are several food delivery options (pizza, burgers, chinese, sushi, bbq, dominican, etc.) I'll also have some good muchies available.

Reply here and let me know if you're interested. I'll PM you with the specifics. 

Happy New Year's!

I know that vote counts are technically hidden for a while after a submission is first posted to avoid this kind of thing but apparently this is not good enough.

Let's pretend that a user is a total nutjob. He/she checks my history every five minutes just to downvote, post my personal information at every turn and then deletes that account to avoid detection and starts a new account to repeat the whole process. Can we do anything about this?

I had to stop at a light in my neighborhood (Washington Heights, NYC). Another cyclist on a Cervelo in a full local club kit pulls up next to me at the light. We nodded at each other as cyclists often do. I recognized his face but couldn't place it under the helmet and sunglasses. I asked him if I'd met him before. He laughed and said, ""Si! I you pizza!"" in a thick Dominican accent. He was my pizza delivery guy. We both had a good laugh and shook hands.


We were both going the same direction so we rode together, traded pulls and chatted for a while. We asked each other about kids and family, the usual small talk and pleasantries. 

After about 15 miles, I was already hurting from the pace. We got a short break when we had to walk our bikes for a block. This is when he tells me that he moved here from the Dominican Republic to train to become a professional road racer. 

He told me that delivering pizzas is the best job for him because he gets paid to ride a heavy mountain bike up steep hills and sprint up apartment building stairs on foot all day to work out his legs. When he told me he was doing all this to become a professional racer as to provide for his mother, wife and children a better life than he had as a boy, he had a special glimmer in his eye.

I had a glimmer in my eye, too, but it was because I was about to cry.

We came to the foot of the Williamsburg Bridge and I was still hurting after a couple blocks of walking rest. We got back on our bikes and clipped in. He gave me a sly grin and asked, ""Fast now?""

He jumped on the pedals and took off like a rocket up the bridge saying something like ""See you soon!"" I tried my hardest to keep up with him.

Apparently, he meant he'd see me soon when I need another pizza, not on the other side of the bridge.

Well played, Jesus. See you soon!"

I studied it in school and used to be pretty good. I've lost a lot of my skill from having not played in ages.

This morning, I was practicing in a tunnel which connects two subway stations right by my apartment. The acoustics are simply amazing -- and let's be honest -- the extra cash tossed in the case by hurried morning commuters is a good incentive to practice.

So, I'm playing one of my favorite songs which is fairly difficult, ""Paranoid Android"" by Radiohead, when I see a figure standing over me. Usually, that means that someone is fishing in the pockets for some change or a single dollar bill. I was concentrated on the fret board so I didn't look up immediately. Generally, I make a point to look at people and smile. However, this particular part of the song was tricky so I had to keep my eyes on my fingers. 

When I could, I looked up to smile at the observer and realized it was in fact an officer of the law.

I stopped playing.

**Me:** *""Good morning, officer. You a big Radiohead fan?*

**Officer:** *""What are you doing?""*

**Me:** *""You're lookin' at it. I'm not sure what else to say, sir.""*

**Officer:** *""I mean, what are you doing here? -- besides trying to make a little money?""*

**Me:** ""*Practicing and giving the nice people some music to listen to during their commute... and making a little money, honestly.*""

**Officer:** ""*I mean, are you homeless?*""

**Me:** ""*No, sir. I have a nice apartment right upstairs. I have lived there for about six years.*""

**Officer:** ""*You're not homeless?*"" 

**Me:** ""*No, sir.*""

**Officer:** ""*And you live right upstairs, you say?... and you just come down here to practice and make a little extra money?*""

**Me:** ""*Yes, sir.*""

**Officer:** ""*Can I see some ID, bud?*""

**Me:** ""*Absolutely.*""

(I hand him my ID)

**Officer:** ""*Have you ever been arrested before?*""

**Me:** ""*No, sir. Totally clean.*""

**Officer:** ""*Totally clean?*""

**Me:** ""*Yes, sir. I'm a good guy.*""

**Officer:** ""*Well, Mr. SoManyMinutes... you seem like a good guy.*""

**Me:** ""*Thank you, officer. I appreciate that.*""

**Officer:** ""*You know that you're not supposed to be here, right?*""

**Me:** ""*Yes, I know.*""

**Officer:** ""*Okay, well. I'm not gonna bust your balls about it. You've got money in your case so I guess people enjoy what you're doing. Just don't start any trouble, okay? -- 'cause if you do then I'll get in trouble and you don't want that. Cool?*""

**Me:** ""*Totally cool. Thank you, officer. Have a good day.*"" 

**Officer:** ""*You, too. I like your version of that song by the way. Take care, Mr. SoManyMinutes.*""

There are some good cops out there. "

I was fine with the sermon until she said...,/r/atheism/comments/on7sx1/i_went_to_church_today_i_was_fine_with_the_sermon/,"My cousin and his wife are clandestine Christian missionaries in the Middle East. Sorry, I can't tell you where for their safety. They've been doing it for years and they're funded entirely by Christian churches' offerings plates.  


I only get to see them once every several years. They were speaking at a family member's church today (obviously to raise money) to fund their unwanted meddling in people's lives halfway across the planet.  


I'd never been able to really hear how my cousin and his wife justify what they do and I was fascinated to hear it in a welcoming setting. They couldn't really say much because the church service is simulcast on the internet and it's a major security risk for them and their organization. This is why I went to church today.  


After my cousin spoke, the pastor delivered her sermon.  


As the title says, I was totally fine with the message of the sermon until the very last bit. She was talking about how you can't choose your lot in life but you can choose whether to dump either water or gasoline on the fire. She was referencing a story in the book of Acts. Fair enough. I completely agree with her even though we come at it from two diametrically opposed angles.  


Then she kept talking and I nearly walked out when she said the following: ""To be inclined to do the right thing is 'supernatural'. We're not built that way. The only way we can choose to do the right thing is by the grace of Jesus Christ.""  


After the service, I waited for an opening in the lobby and asked if I could speak to her away from everyone for a moment. Her eyes lit up. She thought I was going to ask her how I can come to know Jesus.   


Wrong.  


""You're a very good speaker. You're clearly very sharp. I mean the following with the same respect you afforded me during the end of your sermon.""

Her face went from giddy to cautiously hopeful.  


""For you to say that we are not inclined to do the right thing and the only way for people to do the right thing is 'supernatural'(Jesus) -- It's possibly the most insulting thing you can say to a non-believer. I am inclined to do the right thing simply because it's the right thing to do. You just told me that I'm incapable of being a good person. I take serious offense to that. Isn't your job to win over people like me? At any rate, I enjoyed the rest of it.""

Her: ""Oh, gosh! I'm so sorry you feel that way!""  


Me: ""Aight then."

A particularly egregious example of a ""ghost kitchen"".",/r/okc/comments/ryj41g/brooklyn_calzones_okc_doesnt_exist_a_particularly/,"*^(\*are there any spreadsheet people here who can put all the info in this post into a sortable table?)*  


Most of us who hate money and torch it by ordering food delivery from DoorDash, etc., are aware of ""ghost kitchens"".

For those who aren't familiar -- a ghost kitchen is a concept which was brought about due to Covid. Restaurants were going under because nobody was coming. So, someone had the idea that 3 or 4 smaller restaurants would close their doors and rent kitchen space from a larger restaurant so that they could still do delivery. It's a great idea, win win!

Like any good idea it didn't take long before corporate money turned it to shit.

In this case, we're talking about Brooklyn Calzones.

I lived in and around Brooklyn, NYC for fifteen (15) years so I was excited/hesitant when I saw the listing near me on Doordash because I'd never heard of the place and I keep up with what's going on around my area.

There were a few immediate red flags.

1. Every calzone costs >$16. (a proper calzone in NYC is $4.50 tops)
2. Every calzone is named after a neighborhood in Brooklyn (almost). The ingredients are completely random. The belly laugh came when I saw that 'The Heights' (my hood, not in Brooklyn) is made with pesto chicken. Washington Heights is 99.9% Dominican. I was so confused  about how they thought they were going to make a calzone out of stewed chicken, rice and mashed plantains. Nope. Pesto Chicken and mozzarella. Right, okay.
3. A google search for ""Brooklyn Calzones OKC"" returns basically nothing but a buried address.

So I reverse look-up'd the address and it's the address of a really terrible cardboard and fake cheese pizza joint near me. They only charge, like, $12 for a large supreme so I was really curious about the $16 personal calzone from the same address under a different name.

I called them.

Long story short: I asked who designed the ""Brooklyn Calzones"" menu that they're baking in their kitchen.

He told me point blank, ""DoorDash or Uber Eats.""

**These delivery companies are creating restaurants out of thin air and charging insane prices for food with absolutely zero QC and then doubling the price again for the delivery.**

**Meanwhile, the little guy who was renting kitchen space gets pushed out by someone who's not even there.**"

(online),/r/poker/comments/s0sfyn/bankroll_rebuild_challenge_4_to_254_in_two_days/,"On Friday night I lost my whole bankroll. I went from $300+ to $4.31. It was brutal. Coolers and out-draws all night long.

When I woke up on Saturday morning I was certain that it was just a bad dream. I logged in and it was absolutely not a bad dream. I had exactly $4.31 in my account. I make a good portion of my income from poker so I \*must\* be at the tables Saturday and Sunday. I was going to top off with $100 so I would have something to work with... but then I didn't.

**I decided to see what I could do with $4.31 as an experiment.**

The Ignition software won't let me copy/paste my history so I'll outline it below. All games are NLHE, some cash some tournaments:

\[.05/.10 Cash ($4.31)\]

Leave with $5.50+

\[$5 MTT (a thousand players)\]

Leave with $9

\[.05/.10 Cash ($9)\]

Leave with $33

\[$25, 18-players w/ $10 KO\]

4 KOs: +$40

1nd Place: +80

\*\*\~$120 so far.\*\*

\[$15 Triple-Up\]

\-$15.00

\[$15 Triple-up\]

\+$45

\[$15 Triple-Up\]

\-$15.00

\[$15 Triple-up\]

\+$45

\[$25, 18-players w/ $10 KO\]

1 KO: +$10

2nd Place: +80

**Total: $250+**

I did this on Saturday and Sunday. I played pretty much all day both days but never stayed up too late or went hungry or anything.

It's totally doable, folks!

\*edit: Formatting nightmare. Also, I'm working on stitching together screenshots so that everyone can see it for themselves. It might be more trouble than it's worth."

I bolted. I kicked the pedals through the alleys and lost the cops.

This should include hands where I got my money in behind preflop on purpose for a draw. For instance, I raise in middle position with 6d7d and get called by AK. Flop comes 4d5dQs. Turn is Jc. River 10h. It's just jaw dropping!
