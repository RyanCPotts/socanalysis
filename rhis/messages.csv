#**Community Spotlight**

**r/PovertyFinance**

* r/PovertyFinance is a source of advice and community for 1.5 million subscribers now! Empowered by [Reddit’s Community Funds program](https://mods.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/4959902393741-Community-Funds), their mod team facilitated a giveaway of 500 Costco memberships to celebrate and give back to their [subscribers](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/zdd18x/povfs_great_big_15_million_subscriber_giveaway/) during the season of giving. These memberships will help people and their families obtain necessities while also helping them with goals around saving.

**r/Animal_Sanctuary** 

* This community features the best of both worlds – it is both informational and cute! This mod team has invested a lot of effort into ensuring the community’s content is sourced exclusively from non-profit animal rescues. Their posters are encouraged to include links to the websites and social media platforms of the rescues so others can show their support through donations or the written word. The mod team shows grace to new users and redirects content that may be a better fit to other animal related communities. The spirit of this community is very kind and we appreciate the mod team’s desire to help animals and related organizations.

**r/Dogue**

* Meet r/Dogue, a creative community where you can view pets styled in the cover style of Vogue! Thank you to this mod team for hosting a creative space where people can discover [who’s really a good boy](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogue/comments/z8vq0m/teddy_how_you_doin/) and [help Wilma find her ears.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogue/comments/xgsswv/wilma_the_snoopervisor/)

**r/Eredivisie**

* This community’s mod team experienced sudden growth - from 20,000 subscribers to 50,000 subscribers - during the World Cup! They took the growth in stride, maintaining a [line-up thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eredivisie/comments/ywpiq9/dutch_nt_world_cup_line_up_discussion/) to keep the community well-organized. Thank you for curating a great space for Dutch football lovers!

**r/Comics**

* The r/Comics modteam held an [epic event](https://www.reddit.com/r/comics/comments/z5ykmd/epilogue_two_million_subscriber_event/) to celebrate their milestone of two million subscribers. They thought of a creative way to highlight 44 comics that allowed each comic to be stickied for visibility for two days, thus helping the comic creator to promote their work and social platforms. The mod team also held a separate raffle to award Reddit Premium to three lucky users. This was a really well thought out and executed celebration, and we are so glad to see how many users enjoyed it. Thanks to this mod team for all that was done here.

**r/HipHopHeads**

* A series of [2022 music album write-ups](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/z8y4kh/2022_album_of_the_year_writeups_calender/) will be hosted by this community’s mod team beginning on December 15, 2022. This event will allow each poster to have a stickied post they have written about their favorite album they want to share with their fellow community members. This is a great idea and we are excited to discover some new artists from it!

**r/AskHistorians**

* To celebrate 1.5 million subscribers, the mod team at r/AskHistorians is [giving away 1.5 million historical facts!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/yfs7uh/askhistorians_has_hit_15_million_subscribers_to/) The celebration thread is filled with facts to learn about, so be sure to give it a read.

This past October was positively saturated with ghouls, goblins, gremlins, and grizzly specters of all sorts. Not to worry though! Despite being positively saturated with Monster Mashing (AOOOO), we’ve been working our little cotton socks off organizing Mod World 2023, Mod Roadshow, and a whole host of Community Funds projects. There’s a lot to go over this month, so let’s get cracking!

#**Updates from the Admins**

We kicked off October by announcing a new round-up series on /r/modnews: [Mod Monthly!](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/170o2zo/introducing_the_mod_monthly/) In the ides we announced Collectible Expressions, a new type of comment media for Collectible Avatars managed in your subreddit’s Posts and Comments mod tools.

*Technically* we announced this in November, but it’s kind of a big deal so it bears repeating here: **we are once again [removing dormant subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/17pb48y/removing_dormant_subreddits/)** to free up subreddit names for new communities. If you have questions in the meantime, [here’s where to ask](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/17pywew/did_you_just_receive_a_message_from_ureddit_with/). We’ll mention this again in next month’s Snoosletter. 

In mid-October, we expanded the rollout of our [improvements](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/17hxorx/update_regarding_native_mobile_modmail/) (that we are still improving) to mobile modmail. 

Do you have questions about moderation on Reddit? Our last post in the modosphere was [this fresh sticky](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/17m8wfc/how_to_get_help_on_rmodsupport/) on how to get mod support in, well, /r/modsupport.

Last month we announced a [new desktop mod experience](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/15rxkbn/announcing_a_new_desktop_moderator_experience_and/) geared toward making the mod queue easier to read and work with– check out our post for a full rundown. We’re aiming to launch those new features early next year. In the meantime, our Help Center just got a [major update](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/1608391/updates_to_how_well_be_supporting_our_moderators/)! We launched a peer-to-peer support system in /r/modsupport (complete with new available trophies…), and we have a new /r/modsupport modmail answer bot that utilizes the aforementioned improvements to the Help Center.

#**Community Interest**

As you know subreddit activity levels can fluctuate throughout the year. /r/golf just wrapped on the [BMW Championship](https://www.reddit.com/r/golf/comments/15tmmwi/official_discussion_thread_2023_bmw_championship/) and will be teeing up for two more tournaments next month. Meanwhile, art attacks per capita will soon be on the rise as creative communities across Reddit prepare for the spooky season– yes, Halloween is but two months away. Get your spooky avatar and costume sorted before it’s too late! /r/HungryArtists can help with the avatar, and check out /r/sewing’s yearly megathread to get help with costume prep! They’ll answer your FAQs, help find fabric and patterns, teach you how to turn on a sewing machine, and everything else you need to dress to the nines (hells, that is).

Does your community host a seasonal event? Have you done something cool with flair, have a wiki you’re dying to show off, or have some other clever use of mod tools you’d like to share with other mods? Send us a message to let us know how you’re building your community on Reddit and we just might feature your community in next month’s Snoosletter!

#**Updates from the Admins**

Our biggest news from November involved a heads up that we had a plan for [Removing Dormant Subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/17pb48y/removing_dormant_subreddits/) in November (this has happened, yay) and this [announcement about a new mobile Mod Queue](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/187p0wl/announcing_a_new_mobile_mod_queue/). Mods may start seeing the revamped mod queue as early as this week, but please be aware that the rollout will be gradual and may extend into the new year (we’re taking our time to ensure everything works as intended). People were particularly pleased to hear that this change would permit them to remove comments more quickly, without providing a removal reason. 

And, ok, technically it was in December but in case you missed it: [Mod World happened](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditCommunityEvents/comments/189c1tk/mod_world_2023_thats_a_wrap/). Thousands of mods came together to hear from other mods and admins about spam, inclusion, and what happened when u/spez joined the mod team of r/amitheasshole. To give us feedback on Mod World 2023, [please fill out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdAohr2qr1PsWyq8r-cK-tNA806RgkuYYrN6EzNjoCSUEBdjw/viewform)! We read every single comment. 

At Mod World, we launched [Reddit for Communities](https://www.redditforcommunity.com/), a new hub for all sorts of information that could help mods, such as [weekly guides](https://www.redditforcommunity.com/mods-getting-started) for your first month of community-building as well as [community success stories](https://www.redditforcommunity.com/community-stories) for those wondering how other great communities came to be. If you have a success story to share with other Reddit mods, [please fill out this form](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360001103212&tf_360035181512=redditforcommunity_feedback).

Finally, in this month’s round of “is that really modnews?”.... You may notice some different colors on r/modnews, r/modsupport and other official places. It’s because we [updated Reddit’s branding last month](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/186up3s/hearts_thumbs_and_other_reddit_brand_updates/). NB: [Snoo has thumbs!](https://i.redd.it/ttn8si4cqy5c1.png)

You’ll find all that and more on r/modnews and r/reddit, open 24/7 for your news-and-discussion-related enjoyment. Be the first to know what’s happening on Reddit by subscribing to each; we’d love to see you there.

Have a subreddit on your modlist that you're feeling less than excited about? You can hand that community over to a new set of mods fairly easily. The quickest way is to [remove yourself](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/15484268024596-Can-mods-be-removed-), which is totally okay to do. If a community becomes mod-less, then it is free to be adopted via the r/redditrequest process. For a more hands-on approach, you can put your community up for adoption via r/adoptareddit and choose your successors yourself. And if you just want to get a bit of help from other mods (or volunteer to help others!), head on over to r/needamod. (Obligatory [“It’s dangerous to go alone - take this”](https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/2258-its-dangerous-to-go-alone-take-this) for completionists.)

#**Community Interest**

Speaking of communities doing cool things, [r/firefighting](https://www.reddit.com/r/Firefighting/) had an exciting milestone recently – they reached 100,000 subscribers! This is a community for all things fire and rescue, open to the general public along with career and volunteer firefighters and appreciators of firefighting culture. They even have a weekly employment thread that helps users looking to jump start a career as firefighters. Check them out!

On the opposite spectrum of light and heat lives r/ContamFam, which hosts a collection of mycopals who help each other overcome the many challenges of mushroom cultivation. The subreddit features an educational collection of blogs and videos on how to treat and prevent contamination that can destroy a mushroom cultivation in their sidebar. If you’re interested in the science of fungi (mycology), this might be a fun new community to join.

Reddit is a place for creating community and belonging, not for attacking marginalized or vulnerable groups of people.

To avoid future bans, make sure you read and understand [Reddit’s Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy), including [what’s considered promoting hate](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045715951-Promoting-Hate-Based-on-Identity-or-Vulnerability).  

If you use Reddit with a different account and continue to promote hate, or if you’re reported for any further violations of [Reddit’s Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) after your seven-day ban, additional actions including permanent banning may be taken against your account(s).

#**Community Spotlight**

**r/NewToReddit**

* On September 2nd, this helpful community will have been around for *thirteen years*, and they celebrated 30k members [with a party.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/comments/wjk3uc/30000_member_party/) Focused on helping new redditors find their way alongside their sister community, r/LearnToReddit, this community has historically been wonderful in helping users navigate the platform. Mods often send users in need of assistance here so the users can receive a helping hand from peer users and moderators. We are so thankful for this mod team’s dedication to what they are passionate about and for all of the grace they’ve extended to new Redditors.

**r/BetterCallSaul**

* A frequent reader of r/BetterCallSaul wanted to nominate this community for a feature, citing that “The mods do an amazing job of making sure that nothing gets spoiled. It’s an amazing community full of passionate, insightful members.” We took a look and must agree! This community is exceptionally well organized and everyone seems to be having a great time. Thank you to this mod team for inspiring such joy in their community members!

**r/Autumn**

* Whether you are entering into Spring or Fall, r/Autumn is a great place to be. The mod team here compiles all sorts of fun events during the peak season of August from September to December, such as theme days and contests.

Congratulations on the recent milestone, and thanks for hosting such a great space for your members!

Good morning or your regional equivalent everyone! We have a bunch of feathered (and fuzzy!) friends to share with you this month, as well as a delightful set of hands-on subreddits and a ton of on-site news and updates. Let’s get right to it. 
 
&nbsp;
_____

#**Community Spotlight**

**r/hummingbirds**

* Do you have a backyard hummingbird feeder? Do you want to live vicariously through fellow redditors that do? For your daily dose of ruby-throated (and others!) goodness, hop by the /r/hummingbirds community for feeder shots, how-to’s, and nest pics.

**r/autoimmom** 

* Read as: “Auto-immune mom,” a subreddit for parents (not just moms, though we do love a good pun here at Reddit) living with an autoimmune or chronic disease. Come laugh, vent, cry, or love with someone who’s been where you are!


**r/owlsintowels** 

* Exactly what it sounds like, /r/owlsintowels is a sub dedicated to pics and videos of rescue owls in towels. They’re celebrating a 3,000 member milestone, so if you’re a who-rito fan… (get it? Owls say “who” and they’re wrapped…we’ll workshop it) or just need some more wholesome bird content on your feed, this sub is for you.


**r/shmupdev** 

* /r/shmupdev is a subreddit dedicated to shoot-em-up game devs and connection to the shmup community! If you’re developing a shoot-em-up title or are a long time fan looking for the best indie gems, give /r/shmupdev a sub!


**r/furniturerepair** 

* Have a coffee stain on your table? Did your cat leave bite marks in your chair? /r/furniturerepair is the place for you! Whether it’s leather, metal, wood, marble, or more, this is the sub that’ll turn your furniture DIY into DI-Done. (This sub also comes highly recommended for those who like seeing things taken apart and put back together again.)


**r/tbrzero** 

* “To-be-read zero.” Do you have a shelf full of books that you’ve been telling yourself you’ll read…eventually? Sometime soon. When you’re not so busy. Tomorrow, for sure. /r/tbrzero is a community dedicated to getting that “to be read” pile down to zero through encouragement, motivation, and advice on identifying books that maybe you won’t enjoy as much as the cover might suggest.


**r/REWRabbits** 

*  A subreddit celebrating adorable Ruby-Eyed-White Rabbits! *Hop* on by if you’re thinking about adopting a pet rabbit, already an owner looking to connect with other long-eared fans, or looking for an extra dose of ruby-white sweetness in your day! 

**r/HyruleEngineering**

* A fast-growing subreddit showcasing the best (and worst) creations from The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Did you make a speedboat? A quadcopter? A 1:1 scale gundam? Did you create a machine whose only function is transmuting inertia into contagious laughter? Come share your designs and yoink the ones you like for your own purposes!

**r/Lighthouses**

* A growing subreddit dedicated to the history and exploration of lighthouses! Come fawn over the architecture and stories lighthouses the world over have to tell…or get some great ideas for stops on your next coastal walkabout!

We’re reaching out because you have Reddit Premium and/or Reddit Coins on your account. 

TL;DR: We're making updates to awards and coins on Reddit that we'll complete by September 12, 2023. As part of this, we made a decision to move away from Reddit coins and awards. This includes the 700 monthly coins* and Premium Awards, which are currently part of the Reddit Premium experience. 

You'll still be able to use your Reddit Coins until September 12, after which they'll be removed from your account.

*Note: all other current [Premium perks](https://www.reddit.com/premium) will still continue to exist, including the ad-free experience.*

As we looked at our current awarding system, there was consistent feedback from redditors that stood out – particularly around the clutter from awards and all the steps involved with awarding content. We also learned that redditors want awarded content to be more valuable. With that, we are reworking how great content and contributions are rewarded on Reddit. We will have more updates to share soon. 

If you have further questions please check out our [announcement post](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/14ytp7s/reworking_awarding_changes_to_awards_coins_and/) to read more about the update.

I work remote jobs only.

Indeed sucks but it's a starting point. I had a ton more luck with ZipRecruiter.

The key is you have to be one of the first to apply. Which means you're watching the job boards as a job. I usually would refresh every 2 hours so 4-5x a day you know what's new and you're the first to apply to appropriate jobs.

I've got ~30 years experience so my stack is pretty much everything Microsoft from the 90s on. Obviously with a bunch of web / cloud / db / etc on top of that. I have a degree in MIS as well from OU. There you learned basics, telecom, databases (RDBMS theory), programming (was COBOL and C back then, probably Java today), DSS/Expert Systems, Systems Analysis & Design, etc.

CS track you learn more in depth stuff like algorithms, data structures, discrete structures, more in depth mathematics, operating systems, more in depth programming (os/network/cloud/distributed).

I did a few of these courses for fun too (algorithms, data structures, operating systems, network programming). In addition to learning tons of now dead OS/Networking stuff (long career).

Hope that helps."

Reddit is a vast network of communities that are created, run, and populated by people all over the world. In order to keep communities welcoming, safe, and great places to be, everyone who uses the platform operates by a shared set of rules. 

> **Permanently banned for harassment**

Reddit is a place for creating community and belonging, not for harassing or bullying people. We don't tolerate any behaviors that discourage others from participating in communities, conversations, or the Reddit platform through harassment, bullying, intimidation, or abuse. Any communities or people that incite or engage in harassment or abuse towards an individual or group will be banned.

> As a result, we’re permanently banning your SoManyMinutes account from Reddit.

If you have questions about Reddit’s rules, we suggest reading and getting acquainted with [Reddit’s Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy). If you continue to break Reddit’s rules through another Reddit account, you’ll be breaking Reddit’s rule against ban evasion, and any additional accounts you have will also be banned.

If you feel like you didn’t break the rules, you can [file an appeal](https://reddit.com/appeals/157dcae7-73ca-4204-825d-d46a47b5d4ca) any time within the next six months and we’ll take a second look.

If you live in the European Union, you can also [contact a settlement body](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/articles/23512591656212) to dispute the decision. You may also have the right to have this decision reviewed by a competent court under the applicable laws of your country.

#**Community Spotlight**

**r/NoLawns**

* The mod team at r/NoLawns has designed a space for its members to enjoy discussing the concept of lessened lawn-mowing and enjoying the beauty of natural landscaping. They recently celebrated a milestone of reaching [100,000 subscribers!](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoLawns/comments/w6a189/thank_you_for_following_the_no_lawn_commitment/) We enjoyed seeing the positive discussion and beautiful photos that this community has shared, and we wish them well as they continue their No Lawns journey.

**r/FortniteBr** 

* r/FortniteBr’s mod team is back with another creative [2 million subscriber](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/w2xw7g/rfortnitebr_2_million_subscriber_event/) event! This team has compiled a fun set of events and prizes, such as a fashion contest, a trivia hunt, a bounty hunt, and more. We really appreciate the creativity and effort put into the designing of these events and know their community members will have a blast celebrating.

**r/StandardIssueCat** 

* The mod team over at r/StandardIssueCat created this community to celebrate the “standard issue pattern” of brown tabby cats. They celebrated reaching 100,000 subscribers by opening up r/TacticalIssueCat, which is for cats of all colors and patterns that are then compared to tactical vehicles. We are pleased to be able to bring two cat-related communities to your attention and are thankful to this mod team for putting so much effort into them!


**r/TheWeeklyKerman** 

*  This community began as a community-run newspaper for the game Kerbal Space Program. This mod team releases weekly newspapers covering the top trending posts from the community, articles, interviews, and special segments. The mod team recently celebrated their 100th issue of the newspaper. We love the creativity and community-oriented aspect of this community.

**r/WeddingShaming**

* The mod team at r/WeddingShaming is celebrating not only 350k subscribers, but the marriage of one of their own mod team members! This community’s mod team does a nice job of setting up rules and a healthy culture to allow their users to find support, humor, and catharsis in their wedding experiences. We appreciate the effort this team has put into keeping this community a space focused on support, and we wish them well as they celebrate their milestones!

**r/NASA**

* We wanted to share a sweet story of how a user [posted asking if people could send memorabilia to their grandmother who was turning 97 and had worked at NASA in the 60s.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nasa/comments/ucmzog/my_grandma_used_to_work_at_nasa_in_the_60s_can/) As one could expect, the NASA community members of Reddit [delivered with some sweet gifts.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nasa/comments/vk1cdq/grandma_update_thank_you_everyone_she_loves_the/)

**r/PrettyLittleLiars**

* This community’s mod team has created a space for its members to discuss the books, television show, and all three spin-off shows of Pretty Little Liars. As one can imagine, this requires a lot of attention to detail, but the mod team here invests a great amount of effort into keeping things organized. Congratulations to the team for their upcoming milestone of 50,000 subscribers!

The community members greatly enjoyed their daily updates to the point where they decided to [host a donation drive](https://www.reddit.com/r/ontario/comments/vcxykd/ontario_jun_15_786_cases_8_deaths_10385_tests_76/ich2rtq/) in honor of the member for a charity of their choice. The drive raised over $25000! We loved seeing how the mod team encouraged the spirit and efforts of one of their members.

**r/AmateurFoodPorn** 

* Are you a home chef who enjoys giving your honest effort in the plating of your dishes, even if you aren’t a professional photographer or a five-star chef?

There are many yummy photos to enjoy here and the sweet mod team of this community would love to see yours!


**r/Suns** 

* A community member of r/Suns wanted to drop a note of appreciation for the mod team - they feel that the mods “have done a fantastic job in maintaining order and civility with an increasing number of followers, bandwagoners or not. They do a phenomenal job.” We appreciated this member’s desire to share this sweet note, and we stopped by r/Suns as well to take a look - they weren’t kidding! This well-organized community features a lot of discussions that members seem to genuinely enjoy participating in. Congratulations to this mod team for curating a happy space.


**r/RedditForGrownUps** 

*  This mod team first began their journey over a decade ago by creating this community to encourage thoughtful conversation among its adult members. The mod team has allowed a nice culture to form by permitting members to share a blend of discussing serious topics, sharing humorous comics, and allowing casual chats. The relaxed style of this community has given it a friendly vibe and we really appreciate how this mod team helped a welcoming community culture develop.

**r/SpicyKittens**

* We know that many are passionate about subscribing to every cat subreddit that exists, and we want to make sure you stay attuned to the latest developments in this regard! This new community is centered around featuring startled (spicy) kittens who are ready to defend their valor.

Can we start having pinned posts of lesser known comedians comedy specials in the sub?

I just checked out Chris Waitkus's half hour special and it was hilarious. It has less than 5K views and I'm sure others would enjoy it.

Grab your Strawberry Wine (and any other songs referencing September, in case our intro theme wasn’t obvious), and let’s get right into this month’s updates and highlights in the modosphere.

#**Updates from the Admins**

Following up on another post in August, we announced our roadmap to [improving mod queue.](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/16hw505/another_mod_queue_2024_update/) In addition to consistently placed key actions and context panels, our [Developer Platform](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/14945211791892-Reddit-Developer-Interfaces) will enable further modqueue customization. We also boosted Automod’s ability to help fight spam via a new [Contributor Quality Score](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/16is6dh/contributor_quality_score_available_to_all/) (CQS)-- now available to all communities.

Near the end of the month we announced the addition of Rule 5 to our [Mod Code of Conduct](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/16rytt6/new_to_mod_code_of_conduct_moderate_with_integrity/): “Moderate with integrity.” You can view a full breakdown (as well as see some comment reply context from other admins) in the linked post. Soon thereafter, we announced new [protections for communities with inactive mods.](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/16sqqx9/new_protections_for_communities_with_inactive_mods/) These changes will prevent “inactive moderators” (term defined in post) from taking potentially disruptive actions in your subreddit– such as popping out of dormancy to remove all mods below themselves. There’s a *lot* to this one, so we recommend checking out the post yourself; a TL;DR does not do this update justice. We’ve also [updated the Top Mod Removal (TMR) process](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/wiki/top_mod_removal) to reflect this new functionality.

We also announced the rollout of [a new *optional* community safety setting](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/16trwxd/introducing_mature_content_filters/) that automatically filters potentially sexual and graphic content. You can toggle it on and off in your mod tools > safety > mature content filter; now available to everyone!

Lastly, riiiiight at the end of September, we launched [an all new native modmail experience](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/16uqnxz/the_chronicles_of_mobile_modmail_a_new_dawn/) for our mobile users, which at the time you’re reading this will be rolled out to everyone on our native apps. Check out our post for the full story and give us feedback on the new look! 

&nbsp;

_____

**MPT (*Mod Pro Tip*):** 

You can automatically filter visual content that likely contains sexual or graphic imagery! Head to your mod tools > Safety > Mature content filter, where you can designate removal of the types of content you prefer. [More on that new tool here.](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/18343785363220)

Reddit Recap is coming soon and this year we’ll have…community Recaps! That’s right, Recap is coming to subreddits. 

*What will be included?* 
We don’t want to spill all the details, but expect a look back at:

* Top posts
* Actions and visits
* Top regions
* And more! 

*What does this have to do with your subreddit?*

You moderate a subreddit that will get a community Recap! So we’re reaching out ahead of Recap going live to give you a heads up.

* Note: only a subset of safe-for-work (SFW) subreddits will be eligible. That means if you moderate multiple subreddits, some of them may not have community Recaps this year. You and your mod team will have the option to opt out of this experience ahead of Recap going live, by going to Mod Settings > Insights on mobile or Mod Settings > Discovery on desktop (setting is not available on old.reddit).

If you’d like your subreddit to have its community Recap, no action is required. Sit back and relax, and you and your community can relive the past year in all its Recap glory.

October tends to be one of the busier months for communities as many mod teams like to host Halloween or Fall-related festivities. In other parts of the world, things also get busy as Spring has sprung for many people!*

*We have also been keeping busy with all things Reddit, and are excited to highlight some communities and share some updates from the Admins with you all. We hope your October goes well, and if you have any plans to celebrate this new season with your communities, please consider writing in to our [feature suggestion](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FModSupport&subject=Snoosletter+Feature+Request) so we can continue highlighting great communities.*

*Thank you for reading, and let’s [roll right into](https://i.redd.it/zbt2v7klx1p91.gif) our Community Spotlight!*

#**Community Spotlight**

**r/Halloween**

* ​​ If you’re celebrating Halloween this year, you may find yourself in need of a costume. However, costume ideas can stump us all - but have no fear, as r/Halloween’s mod team is here to help! They’ve set up a [costume idea request megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/halloween/comments/xhngp5/costume_idea_request_megathread/) so their members can share ideas and help one another out while keeping the community’s main page of content dedicated to other Halloween material. This is a creative way to tackle a very spooky problem!

**r/NASCAR**

* With support from our [Community Funds](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/vofj26/community_funds_applications_are_open/) program, r/NASCAR [featured Reddit’s OrangeRed colors](https://www.reddit.com/r/NASCAR/comments/xla2em/partner_news_im_so_excited_to_share_with_you_all/) and nearly 1,400 community members’ usernames on Ryan Vargas’ Chevy Camaro to race at Talladega! The mod team also set up a meet and greet for community members at the track, and [hosted an AMA with Ryan Vargas for the community](https://www.reddit.com/r/NASCAR/comments/xpvyw1/ryan_vargas_driver_of_the_rnascar_6_at_talladega/e). We are so grateful for this mod team’s creativity and care they’ve shown to their community in using this program to execute such a great project. 

**r/SelfReliance**

* r/SelfReliance just passed 100,000 members - it was adopted by another moderator through our r/RedditRequest program, and the moderator was able to grow the community from fifty subscribers to the mighty 105,000 it is now! The content in the community is relevant to its members’ desires to discuss their experiences regarding self reliance as well as share guides and ideas for how to be more self reliant. We are thankful for this mod team’s passion for curating this educational, supportive community, and we look forward to seeing where you go next.

**r/TwilightImperium** 

* This community is dedicated to a popular board game where strategy meets control, as the player vies to become the galaxy’s ruler amongst five to seven other players. It can be a game that requires a day to devote to, for it can take a while to finish! With this in mind, the mod team over at r/TwilightImperium has cultivated a fun space for their members to enjoy discussing the game, finding co-players, or enjoying some scrolling through the community’s posts as they take a break from the game!


**r/IndiePlushies** 

* Dedicated to nurturing plush makers and filling their members with serotonin, this wholesome community shares and highlights indie stuffed animals from all around the world! Anyone who home-makes or has a small brand for their plushies is welcome to share their plushies in the community, where they meet friendly moderators and appreciative community members. The [spooky plushies](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieplushies/comments/xceh0m/finished_a_little_rabbit_for_halloween_decor/) have already hit the scene, so be sure to take a look at them.

**r/BananasForScale**

* If you’ve ever wondered how large the Record Breaking Pumpkin of Alaska was, this community is here to help. [One banana is shown for scale - the pumpkin truly is huge.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BananasForScale/comments/x4e7iq/alaska_record_breaking_pumpkin_banana_for_scale/) Determined to change the world by proving the ultimate unit of measurement is, in fact, the humble and nutritious banana, this community’s moderation team takes great pride in showcasing random items next to bananas. We appreciate this community’s creativity and passion for their preferred unit of measurement!

**r/No_Small_Parts** 

* Dedicated to sharing screenshots and clips of famous actors as they played in earlier minor roles, this community reminds us all of how quickly things can change! The community’s mod team also has a Weekly Chat Thread for their members to discuss what they’ve been watching recently, which makes for a great opportunity to discuss one’s favorite actors or programming. We appreciate the inspiration that is highlighted within the community from looking back on actors’ histories, and we appreciate this mod team’s effort in creating a space for all to enjoy.


**r/49ers** 

* This one goes out to all of our American football fans - Jimmy Garoppolo of the 49ers team was expected to be traded in the offseason, and a community member decided to draw a picture of him every day until his trade. But recently, he was signed to a one-year contract - meaning the 49ers team will have him on their team for another year. The community member has decided to continue drawing him every day until he is traded. The community is [loving their art](https://www.reddit.com/r/49ers/comments/sjna80/thank_you_for_everything_jimmy/) and [the fun spirit of the daily post!](https://www.reddit.com/r/49ers/comments/x1kqow/drawing_jimmy_g_every_day_until_he_gets_traded/)

**Mod Pro Tip (MPT)**

Did you know that we recently launched our Mod Education program on a new platform? [Reddit’s Mod Education site](https://modeducation.reddithelp.com) is an opt-in, self-led training platform that consists of courses for moderators of all experience levels who are interested in an out-of-the-box learning solution for mod tools, best practices, and more. Try it out for yourself - or, if you’re bringing in mod recruits, consider having them try it in conjunction with your own community-specific training resources. You can use the [feedback link](https://modeducation.reddithelp.com/reddit-mod-education-feedback) in the site’s header navigation bar to let us know what you like, what you don’t like, and to share suggestions for future courses. We’ll be sure to share more here and in r/ModCertification when new courses have landed!

Speaking of longer days, don't forget that Daylight Savings was on the 12th for many of us, and on the 19th for many more, [so remember to turn your clocks forward an hour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time_by_country)! While losing an hour of sleep can be tough, it will also mean we'll have more daylight in the evenings we can look forward to. There will be some exciting celebrations this month like [National Puppy Day](https://i.redd.it/z3mzrnthozja1.gif) and [International Waffle Day](https://i.redd.it/j2o4kmeuszja1.gif), we always have a reason to enjoy some sweetness and cuteness. Additionally, March is [Women's History Month](https://i.redd.it/ms0kbna3blma1.gif), a time to recognize and honor the incredible contributions of women throughout history. So let's celebrate all of the amazing things happening this month, grab some waffles, and enjoy this month's snoosletter! (Sorry for the later than usual snoosletter. But, not to worry, we have plenty of r/modnews posts for you!)

#**Updates from the Admins**

The [curtain rose](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/1897h2v/mod_world_is_happening_now_get_help_here/) on December when we gathered for [Mod World 2023](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/1896oqn/mod_world_is_happening_now_get_help_here/), an evolution of previous Mod Summit events you may be familiar with. That same day we announced Reddit For Community and, as of December 5, thanks in no small part to input from the Mod Council, mod reordering is now self-serve to mods with “everything” permissions. We capped off the week (yes, this was just one week!) with a full cast of [mod-centric mobile updates](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/18d3gp2/updates_from_the_mod_front_mobile_modmail/). 

Soon after we gave an update on Post Guidance, announced an update to your Mod Insights page, and announced the return of Adopt an Admin (AAA) in early 2024. December wrapped up (or maybe the curtain fell, if we’re keeping this theme) with Mod Monthly and our [Q3 Safety and Security Report](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/18m9pwx/q3_2023_safety_security_report/) in /r/redditsecurity. Full rundowns on each of these topics can be found, as always, on /r/modnews.

Posting, Commenting, and Voting in a subreddit or on an item is a signal to Reddit and their advertisers that the participant believes that the community or comment or post has a legitimate reason for existing and serves a purpose for them. 


There is no conversation where you will educate or enlighten the other participants of a subreddit that has had **years** to cultivate their audience. 


If this is something you can accept, to stop participating in the target subreddit, then please reply. If the bot hits you again for the same subreddit, you will not be unbanned a second time.

If you don't want to stop helping the target sub and their advertisers, then you can just ignore this message.

My name is Hind, and I’m currently a Ph.D. candidate at HBKU majoring in Computer Science and Engineering.

My research focuses on detecting hate	oxicity in social media platforms like YouTube, Facebook, and Reddit.

Recently, I’ve been interested in the moderation process in Reddit and how communities are kept safe (i.e., free of hate and toxicity) for users to enjoy.

For that, I’m reaching out to you and other moderators on Reddit to help me with my study.

I want to conduct a survey, where you will answer some questions related to moderating online communities.

Your input will be valuable to my research, as it will bridge the gap between the technical side of my work and what moderators doequire to monitor communities.

You can locate the URL to the survey here: https://forms.gle/WuDkAtcntV5nwCU66

Looking forward to your participation,

Hind"

I've messaged the mod group with no response so I am messaging you directly. I tried to post a discussion post twice on the /r/StandUpComedy sub and it was removed by spam filters both times. Can you please explain why? My account is not new and I have participated in the sub. I thought it might have been because there was no text so I resubmitted but it still got removed.

[Attempt 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/StandUpComedy/comments/qwiqo4/discussion_thread_michael_che_shame_the_devil/) [Attempt 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/StandUpComedy/comments/qxkj6e/michael_ches_shame_the_devil_discussion_thread/)

As the main stand-up discussion sub on reddit, I think it would be cool to have a sticky post that links to individual discussion threads for specials/albums that came out that month. Similar to /r/movies. Regardless of that suggestion, I still notice a lack of centralized discussion on new specials/albums that come out. So I created this thread. I would like to continue to create threads like this for new specials as they come out.

Please help me understand why my post was removed. If it is from the auto moderator, then perhaps the settings on it need to be tweaked, as I don't see any reason my post would flag anything.

Thanks."

Where has the year gone? Hard to believe that 2019 is almost over.

Now onto a few highlights and updates from the past month.

&nbsp;
_____


#**Community Spotlight**

**r/arrow**

* With the TV show Arrow coming into its final season this fall, r/arrow has hit the [100k subscriber](https://www.reddit.com/r/arrow/comments/ctx5k2/100k_congratulations_we_have_reached_100k/) milestone! This subreddit has seen some twists and turns, much as the show itself has, and now the community is rallying together for a final sendoff for the show.

**r/AmITheAsshole**

* The mods over at r/AmITheAsshole noticed an interesting trend: [most of their top voted comments were made in the first five minutes after a post was made… which meant a lot of good quality comments weren’t getting any traction at all](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/cjresy/so_we_decided_to_fuck_with_the_sub/), just because they were posted later. So they devised an experiment: all posts would go in contest mode for the first 30 minutes (bumped to 60 minutes after community feedback), then it would switch to best sort. This allowed more comments to be visible, and scores to be hidden, so comments would get an unfair advantage of getting votes just for being first. After overwhelming positive feedback and a poll, the [new sorting is here to stay](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/cszj7a/60minute_contest_mode_is_here_to_stay_please_read/). This is a really awesome example of seeing a problem, trying out a change, and altering based on community feedback, and definitely NAH. 

**r/sushi**

* We’ve seen some pretty great community awards since we launched them a few months back, but the ones that r/sushi have (ahem) [rolled out](https://www.reddit.com/r/sushi/comments/ct9cj6/meta_community_awards_now_available/) are really [gorgeous](https://i.redd.it/murw27p05ti31.png) and good enough to eat.

&nbsp;

Thank you to everyone who has written in. While we can’t share everything sent to us, we always look forward to seeing what your communities are doing and how you’re evolving. 

Speaking of — most of the communities we highlight get on our radar *by writing in and sharing what they are doing directly*. Let us know what cool things your mod team and community have been up to by [sending a message here](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Freddit.com&subject=Newsletter%20highlight%20suggestion)!

#**Updates from the Admins**

We had a few updates this month, as well as a fancy limited time experimental feature that had all the folks dabbing their fridges.

&nbsp;

* **[We took a new toy, RPAN for a spin!](https://www.reddit.com/r/pan/comments/csjqqy/announcing_rpan_a_limitedtime_live_broadcasting/)** This experiment in broadcasting gave us some interesting information and more of the amazingness that is Reddit. In true Reddit fashion we saw lots of v goode doggos, cats, lizards, hedgehogs, and pets of every variety, as well as someone reading the script for The Bee Movie, folks dabbing, sharing their hobbies, and of course showing us their fridges. Want to weigh in on the conversation? Head over to r/pan!
* **[We announced changes to the modlog, that will show you when we make copyright removals.](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/cnompz/copyright_removals_now_included_in_modlog/).** We also hosted an AMA with u/EFFMitch to talk about copyright more broadly, so check out the comments there for some good information.
* **[Wiki Editing is now available on New Reddit! Rejoice!](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/cu0uq2/wiki_editing_and_revisioning_now_available_in_new/)** This also includes a REAL way to create new wiki pages. Double rejoice!
* **[There is a new leaderboard showing fastest growing communities.](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/cufyo5/todays_top_growing_communities/)** This is a cool way to discover new communities, and for mods to see how they compare with other subreddits. (Check out your communities are doing [here](https://new.reddit.com/subreddits/leaderboard/moderating/).)
* **[A new pilot has been launched with 32 communities to test a feature allowing mods to send PMs to their subscribers to highlight specific content.](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/cws3sy/feature_test_a_new_pilot_for_modtomember/)** This is a small pilot right now, and we’re interested to see how mods will use this new feature.

This subreddit is dedicated to discussion about the harmful effects that car dominance has on community, environment, safety, and public health. We aspire towards more sustainable and effective alternatives, including improved pedestrian and mass transit infrastructure. 

For more information on what this r/fuckcars is about visit the fuck cars [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/wiki/faq).

## Please review our rules before posting.

**1\. Be nice to each other.**
  
- Being aggressive or inflammatory towards other users will get you banned. Name calling or obvious trolling falls under that.
- Hate cars, hate the system, but not people. While some drivers definitely deserve some hate, most of them didn't choose car-centric life out of free will.

**2\. No bigotry or hate**
  
- Racism, transphobia, misogyny, ableism, homophobia, chauvinism, fat-shaming, body-shaming, stigmatization of people experiencing homeless or substance users, etc. are not tolerated.
- Don't use slurs.
- You can laugh at someone's fragile masculinity without associating it with their body.
- The correlation between car-culture and body weight is not an excuse for fat-shaming.

**3\. Stay on-topic**
 
- Submissions should be on-topic to the externalities of car culture in urban development and communities globally.
- Don't post literal car fucking.
- Things that happened somewhere else on Reddit are not on topic.

**4\. No traffic violence**
 
- Do not post depictions of traffic violence.
- NSFW or NSFL posts are not allowed.
- Gawking at crashes is not allowed.
- Be respectful to people who are a victim of traffic violence or otherwise traumatized by it.
- News articles about crashes and statistics about traffic violence are allowed.
- Glorifying traffic violence will get you banned.

**5\. No reposts**
 
- Before sharing, check if your post isn't a repost. Reposts that add something new are fine.

**6\. No misinformation**
 
- Masks and vaccines save lives during a pandemic, climate change is real and anthropogenic - and denial of these and other established facts will get you banned.
- False or highly speculative titles will get your post deleted.

**7\. No harassment**
 
- Posts that (may) cause harassment, dogpiling or brigading, intentionally or not, will be removed. Please do not post screenshots containing uncensored usernames.
- Actual harassment, dogpiling or brigading is a bannable offence.

Now that we’re all done being *mostly* disappointed in the [Area 51 Raid](https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/comments/d74g3m/reddit_ruled_today_so_i_arted_it/), we can look forward to what really matters: [using our ovens without melting](https://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/dagzft/homemade_blueberry_pie/) and getting creative for [Halloween](https://www.reddit.com/r/nextfuckinglevel/comments/d93uuj/flawless_robotic_dancing/)!

#**Community Spotlight**

**r/halloween**

* Sensing a theme? Yep. It’s definitely this Spooktober-loving community’s time to shine. Stop by if you need [costume ideas](https://www.reddit.com/r/halloween/comments/d1bby0/its_finally_here_weekly_costume_idea_request/), decoration inspiration, or just enjoy seeing what people have [carved up.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/da1eba/humour_my_pumpkin_for_this_halloween/)

**r/malefashionadvice**

* This intrepid and always impeccably dressed subreddit turned 10 this month! The mods there created a [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/cyqxcq/happy_10th_birthday_mfa/) for everyone to share their favorite memories. Along with sharing their favorite memes, some folks [thanked the community](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/cyqxcq/happy_10th_birthday_mfa/eytre25/) for helping them develop their own personal style. (Side note: We shipped a small change to [show a community’s cake day in the sidebar](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/d9p2mq/cake_day_for_subreddits/), to make it easier for any subreddit to keep track of its anniversaries.)

**r/politics**

* In a different type of anniversary, r/politics recently celebrated [three years of their AMA program](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/cutfyy/rpolitics_is_celebrating_3_years_of_the_ama/). Over the last three years, r/politics has hosted over 300 AMAs with folks from across the political spectrum. It’s been a lot of hard work, but that team has done an amazing job. Congrats!

**r/worldbuilding**

* Quickly approaching their 10-year anniversary, r/worldbuilding is a place where creators can discuss and share their own imaginary worlds with one another. They have great info on how to approach worldbuilding if you’re just starting out, and, as a bonus, it’s clear that a lot of love went into creating the subreddit’s own unique universe through their styling and flair system. Nice job, mods!

#**Updates from the Admins**

* [We’ve started an Emergency Moderator Reserves Program](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/d0k6qx/ideas_from_the_admins_emergency_moderator_reserves/) to help out mods who experience an influx in traffic due to emergencies in their physical communities. We’re hoping this can help relieve stress on mod teams during really difficult times. 

* Continuing on improvements to our /report flow, [now if you select “other” when modmailing r/reddit.com, we’ll auto-propagate the right part of the report form to streamline reporting](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/czrsb8/new_reporting_feature_when_messaging_admins/).

* The AutoMod scheduler was not working as expected, so we [cleaned up the database a bit to help it run more smoothly](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/d2cwdl/update_regarding_issues_with_the_automoderator/). Let us know if your scheduler is acting up.

* We published an [update](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/d6l41l/an_update_on_content_manipulation_and_an_upcoming/) around our approach to content manipulation. This is the kickoff to a series of quarterly reports on r/redditsecurity that will go into more details on what we’ve done in this arena. Make sure to subscribe to r/redditsecurity to keep up to date!

* [We shared a big ol’ post](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/d89lq0/update_moderating_on_new_reddit/
) highlighting the many things we’ve shipped for mods on new Reddit since this time last year. If you aren’t already familiar with all the improvements, check it out and share your thoughts.

#**Events**

**2019 Moderator Thank You Roadshow**

Last month’s trip to Atlanta, Georgia for DragonCon was a smashing success. We had many moderators join us for food and frivolity, as well as some fantastic costume-watching. The next day, we had the honor of hosting a panel to talk about fandom on Reddit, and how our communities keep their favorite properties (books, TV, movies, and so much more) alive online.

And not to be outdone, just last week we met with mods in Denver, Colorado for another awesome roadshow event, with appearances from communities large and small. Special thanks to our friends from r/HighQualityGifs for meeting up with us in Boulder beforehand!

Sadly, this brings our 2019 Roadshow to a close. It’s one of our favorite times of year, and we always love meeting the moderators! Thank you to everyone who came out, and we hope to see more of you in 2020. 

&nbsp;

**Extra Life 2019**

What could be better than binging video or board games for 24 hours? Saving lives while doing it!

[Extra Life 2019](https://www.extra-life.org/reddit) is a fun, rewarding way to bring your community together to play games while raising money for the [Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals](https://childrensmiraclenetworkhospitals.org/)—and it’s just around the corner, on November 2nd. 

We’ve been impressed year after year by what mod teams have done and can’t wait to see what you come up with. If you’re new to this, check out [last year’s announcement post](https://redditblog.com/2018/10/19/extra-life-is-coming/).

Details to come in the next month, so watch r/blog and r/ExtraLife for more info.

#**Community Spotlight**

**r/GenZ** 

*  Who [hit 50k](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/p7goy6/its_50000_of_us/) recently? r/GenZ. Regardless of your generation, you’re sure to find great content in this community thanks to its mod team who have fostered a friendly culture throughout it. Congratulations on hitting that milestone!

**r/TheWeeknd** 

*  r/TheWeeknd [hit 100k subscribers](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheWeeknd/comments/otrzlx/happy_100k_rtheweeknd_mod_applications/) recently (on a weekday, though, not a weeknd…). r/TheWeeknd first began when the musical artist was still distributing his music for free online, and they’ve since nurtured the community alongside his growth into fame. We loved seeing this type of concurrent growth and we wish this community all the best as they continue to grow while celebrating their love for The Weeknd!

**r/thewritespace** 

*  r/thewritespace is a growing community that provides support to a plethora of writers, ranging from beginners to published novelists. If you’re interested in writing or would like to provide support to those who are, don’t hesitate to check out this community. Its mod team has done a fantastic job of cultivating a supportive culture within it.

**r/Latin**

* Lorem Ipsum Greatjobitum to r/Latin on [holding a contest](https://www.reddit.com/r/latin/comments/pkd9ek/join_rlatins_first_attested_recitation_and/) to breathe new life into this dead language + its growing group of redditor enthusiasts


**r/OutoftheTombs** 

*  This new community [has quickly gained a supportive following.](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutoftheTombs/comments/p9hhw5/thank_you_dear_friends_and_collogues_we_hit_5000/) Run by an Egyptologist, this academic community provides an interesting insight into Egypt’s history and culture. Be sure to take a look at it if you’d like to learn something new!

**r/BerneseMountainDogs** 

*  r/BerneseMountainDogs is a great example of a once-dormant community that was revived to become a fun space for all to discuss their love for this breed of dog. The mods of this community have made great efforts in taking the initiative to make the community a great place and have been taking helpful measures to ensure the mod team feels supported as it continues to grow. Don’t hesitate to head over to this community to see some wholesome content!

**r/DunderMifflin** 

* r/DunderMifflin got a [special shoutout](https://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/comments/pavi0o/the_office_and_this_subreddit_have_gotten_me/) from Brian Baumgartner (who played Kevin from The Office), arranged by a user who wanted to show their appreciation for the community. 

**r/WorldOfWarships** 

*  To celebrate 100k, the r/WorldofWarships mod team [held a giveaway with streamers](https://www.reddit.com/r/WorldOfWarships/comments/p78oln/the_bomb_shelter_reddit_100k_subscriber_event/) for their community members. We loved seeing new and old members come together to celebrate the continued growth of their community.

**r/Robotics** 

*  This period has been a great one for the r/Robotics community. r/Robotics crossed the threshold into over 150k members and held their [first online showcase](https://redditroboticsshowcase.wordpress.com/) so members of all ages and skill levels could share and discuss their robotics alongside academic and industry professionals. They have continued plans to bring more events and diversity into their community. We’re in awe of their dedication to their community and wish them all the best going forward!

Welcome to the final Snoosletter of 2018. To those of you still successfully winning [Whamageddon](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/a3bbxw/who_else_is_still_in_whamageddon/), congrats! You’re close to achieving the impossible. 

&nbsp;

A special [holiday hello](https://i.redd.it/sfl0zbwkv7521.gif) to the many mods receiving this for the first time, as we continue to expand to the number of mods we send to. The Snoosletter is meant to highlight communities and share events while keeping you up to date on things you may have missed. If you’re not into it, it’s very easy to opt out and instructions can be found at the bottom of this message. 


&nbsp;

Since this is our last Snoosletter of the year, we wanted to shine a spotlight on a few of the MANY communities on Reddit that focus on helping people improve themselves. This is something a lot of us attempt for about 3-4 days after we ring in the new year, before ultimately breaking down and getting [delicious cheeseburgers](https://i.redd.it/s9p84a8ki8521.gif) delivered. In those dark moments, we’re grateful for the mods that create supportive spaces that help us strive to be our best all year round. 

&nbsp;

#**Community Spotlight**

**r/52book** 

* In r/52book, community members set a goal to read a certain number of books throughout the year, with mods setting weekly stickied threads that encourage sharing and discussion. It’s a pretty excellent community to kick off a new year and challenge yourself. Be sure to stop by the last week of the year for inspiration in their yearly round up posts. 

**r/EatCheapAndHealthy** 

*  Notably one of subbies to most recently hit 1,000,000 subscribers, r/EatCheapAndHealthy provides a great space that inspires folks to share their tips on eating better while saving cash. Something that is probably on a lot of people’s resolutions list for 2019.

**r/loseit**

* The mods of r/loseit have created a community that is full of helpful resources and recurring discussion posts to support people who want to lose a little or a lot of weight. At the time of writing this, the flaired members of the community have collectively lost almost 1,800,000 lbs.

**r/povertyfinance**

* r/povertyfinance has grown substantially since their start just over 8 months ago. Aiming to provide advice and support for people struggling and looking for financial stability and upward mobility, the mods have created a community that has filled a much needed gap.

**r/declutter**

* It’s probably fair to say that “Bless This Mess” is cuter on embroidery than in reality. r/declutter gets that and promotes regular discussions and challenges for those feeling overwhelmed with their own messes and looking for decluttering tips and commiseration. Stop by if you’d like to have a more organized home for 2019.  

**r/bodybuilding**

* Having recently hit 500k subscribers, r/bodybuilding continues to grow, much like its community members. Congrats to the mods for cultivating a community where body builders support each other’s efforts at all levels. And for being the one place you might find yourself getting advice from [The Governator](https://i.redd.it/tunaj0l1ah521.gif).  

&nbsp;

Congrats to the mods of these communities that hit [1,000,000 subscribers](https://i.redd.it/i2ywo8mux8521.gif) recently: 

* r/AnimalsBeingDerps
* r/trashy
* r/ContagiousLaughter
* r/itookapicture
* r/Wellthatsucks
* r/xboxone
* r/BeAmazed
* r/EatCheapAndHealthy
* r/ChildrenFallingOver
* r/Bitcoin
* r/rickandmorty
* r/relationship_advice

And a special shout out to r/rarepuppers, whose mods celebrated their 1,000,000 milestone with [a fundraiser](https://www.reddit.com/r/rarepuppers/comments/9vk958/1_million_subscribers_celebration/
) supporting guide dogs for the blind. And they met their goal! Although the subbie sponsored fundraiser has ended, you can still contribute to their worthy cause [here](https://www.guidedogs.com/).

**The mighty bug bash**


Reddit just wrapped up a [week long bug bash](https://i.redd.it/1czmv6jdp8521.gif) and as the final release notes for 2018, shared the outcome of the bash in r/redesign.

#**Announcements and Upcoming Events**

**Holiday contest**

A quick thanks to the mods who submitted entries into the holiday contest from last month’s Snoosletter. We’ve [picked a winner](https://i.redd.it/spd8ms03w7521.gif) and will be in touch after the new year to hook you up with a little surprise! Everyone else, keep an eye out for more contests coming in 2019.

&nbsp;

**2018 Year in Review**

In case you missed it, we pulled a bunch of data and [put up a blog post](https://redditblog.com/2018/12/04/reddit-year-in-review-2018/) that highlights all kinds of notable stuff, from “most comments per post” to the rise of the term “Bootcut Bandits” in fashion communities. 

&nbsp;

**Friday Threads in r/ModSupport**

We wanted to thank everyone who has shared their experiences in these threads and helped fellow mods by contributing to the [Mod Help Center](https://mods.reddithelp.com/). We’ll be putting a temporary pause on these Friday threads as we work to improve in other areas and continue to expand future articles based on earlier conversations with you all.

1.	Be nice, especially to OP.  
2.	Stay on topic.  Jokes and humor are allowed, if included in a helpful answer to the question, but joke-only comments will be removed.

Particularly if you have expertise you want to share, consider sorting by new to find posts that are not yet well answered, and upvote any on-topic question, especially questions where OP starts out clueless and needs our help.

Hello, u/SoManyMinutes!

As you've probably heard by now, we've been [hard at work](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/7ul5k9/hey_were_here_to_talk_about_that_desktop_redesign/) on the redesign for the past year. As a moderator of a large subreddit, your feedback on how we're doing is critical to us, so we'd like to invite you to test out the alpha, start styling your communities in the redesign before we open it up for beta, and most importantly let us know what you think.

The sense of community users get when they visit a subreddit with its own unique look and format is a huge part of what makes Reddit Reddit, and keeping this community uniqueness has been a central part of our redesign efforts. Please opt into the redesign or visit alpha.reddit.com, where you can visit all of the subreddits that you moderate, begin to style them, and give us your feedback.

We have added you to a community we created called r/redesign, where you can ask others for styling help and share your thoughts with us. Stickied at the top is [a quick TL;DR post](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/7paj7h/welcome_to_the_reddit_redesign/) to welcome you to the community.

Please keep in mind that we still have a lot of work left to do. And all styling changes that you make will only affect the on the redesign website. Today, about 5,000 testers are on the alpha website; however, we will be increasing that number very soon and want to give you an early invitation so that you have a chance to style your community and we have a chance to hear your feedback.

Thanks in advance for your help,

The Reddit Redesign Team

* If you’re into bird watching but also avoiding the current heat, r/birdpics, which hit its 10-year anniversary this month, has you covered. They’re also [supporting a fundraiser to help Quogue Wildlife Refuge](https://www.reddit.com/r/birdpics/comments/chjhzu/our_amputee_bald_eagle_sammy_was_stolen_last_week/) raise funds for improvements after the refuge’s much loved eagle, Sam, was stolen earlier this month.

#**Events and Other Tidbits**

**2019 Moderator Thank You Roadshow**

In July, we took our Mod Roadshow to the home of your 2018 Super Bowl champion Eagles, birthplace of the Declaration of Independence, and stomping ground for some of Reddit's best mods—Philadelphia! Admittedly, we were not prepared for the sweltering heat, but luckily our event was indoors, so we had the cool breeze of [ping pong paddles](https://i.redd.it/9g4kuwrwg8d31.png) whiffing all night long to keep us comfortable. Next up? Atlanta! Since we’re showing up during the city’s annual DragonCon, we expect to be knee-deep in cosplayers, fandoms, and—of course—moderators. Hope to see you there!   

[Upcoming Roadshows](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/auoyjx/presenting_the_third_annual_moderator_thank_you/):

* Atlanta - Friday, August 30

* Denver - Friday, September 20

**Endless Thread Podcast Collaborations**

You may have already heard of the Reddit- and WBUR-partnered podcast u/Endless_Thread. In case you haven’t, the idea behind it is to collaborate with redditors, mods, and communities to share “the [best stories](https://www.wbur.org/endlessthread/archive) found in the vast ecosystem of online communities called Reddit.” They've collaborated with mods from [r/NFL](https://www.wbur.org/endlessthread/2018/02/02/and-its-good), [r/Gratefuldoe](https://www.wbur.org/endlessthread/2018/11/30/grateful-doe), [r/gameofthrones](https://www.wbur.org/endlessthread/2019/04/12/bonus-endless-thrones), and more. 

July's collaboration? A big ol' [TWO](https://www.wbur.org/endlessthread/2019/06/28/we-want-plates)-[PARTER](https://www.wbur.org/endlessthread/2019/07/12/pile-of-crockery), inspired by a [famous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/av975o/i_was_driving_through_the_back_roads_of) from r/WTF about a mysterious pile of plates in the woods. Hosts Amory Sivertson and Ben Brock Johnson got help from [r/mapmaking](https://www.reddit.com/r/mapmaking/comments/bz3syq/looking_to_combine_railroads_campground_locations/) and [r/gis](https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/bzgnd3/looking_to_combine_railroads_campground_locations/) in solving the mystery. On r/gis, mods helped Endless Thread get fellow redditors' input on scouring satellite imagery, using mapping information and details known by the OP about the pile of plates to solve the mystery once and for all. Users, mods and subreddits from the episode all got a shout-out in the podcast! 

If you have ideas and stories from your communities that you think the show should cover, they’d love to hear from you. You can reach out directly at endlessthread@wbur.org.

Sorry for the late Snoosletter. (As you can probably guess, we were busy talking with all of you about more important matters, but the good news is that now we have a few extra days' worth of content and communities to feature for the ol' Snoosletter this month. Speaking of which...)

Thanks to the many and varied communities you all nurture on Reddit, people are finding a lot of positive ways to stay connected while being mostly stuck inside:


* ""Who else is doing it like this sub?!"" one redditor asked after r/popheads [announced they'd be hosting a party](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/ga0fti/announcing_club_bop_the_first_ever_popheads_zoom/) with some exciting guests last Friday. *(Shots fired, fellow music subs, but shout-outs shouted out as well: to r/hiphopheads, r/indieheads, and all the other music communities giving us plenty of music to listen to and discuss in their stickied posts.)*

* When SNL went off the air for a bit, r/LiveFromNewYork [got to work making their own SNL episode,](https://www.reddit.com/r/LiveFromNewYork/comments/g0l33e/rlivefromnewyork_homemade_episode_of_snl_update_3/) which is set to debut in May.

* Hobby and crafting communities are blowing up. r/knitting, r/sewing, r/woodworking, and tons more. Need something to focus on?  [r/JigsawPuzzles has suggestions.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jigsawpuzzles/comments/fldp1e/the_best_jigsaw_puzzles_to_get_you_through/) And if you’re not into puzzles, how about learning to make [something amazing](https://www.reddit.com/r/Embroidery/comments/g8xe2a/i_did_a_thing_only_took_100_hours/) with the help of [r/Embroidery’s
guide?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Embroidery/comments/fkzxxv/how_to_learn_embroidery_social_isolation_edition/)

* And surprising absolutely no one, baking enthusiasm has reached peak levels over in r/Breadit, where plenty of first time bread makers are kneading, fermenting, and sharing their triumphs and [failures.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Breadit/comments/g9rrhu/i_suggested_my_mum_start_making_bread_during/) 

&nbsp;


Before we get to our regular community highlights, a quick shoutout to r/IAmA for [hitting 20 million subscribers](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/g7erda/mod_post_20000000_million_amazing_subscribers/) and r/funny for [hitting 30 million subscribers.](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/g60ozo/rfunny_has_reached_30000000_subscribers/) That’s pretty AMA-zing (and an amazingly un-funny pun), if you ask us.

**r/UnresolvedMysteries**

* Welcome to the rabbit hole, mystery and true crime lovers! r/UnresolvedMysteries hit 1 million subscribers and asked the community for their help choosing the best posts of all time with [this fantastic mod post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/g8fbv0/as_runresolvedmysteries_passes_1000000_members/) Check it out to see some of the oldest and [most loved posts,](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/gcjp4z/here_are_the_best_posts_in_the_history_of/) as well as some data on the community’s growth over the years.

**r/nasa**

* Completely unrelated to all the UFO and alien speculation going around lately, r/nasa also just hit 1 million subscribers and celebrated by hosting this awesome [AMA.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nasa/comments/g1vh9d/im_glenn_bock_an_engineer_and_test_conductor_at/) More AMAs to come over the following months!

**r/polls**

* The launch of the [polls post type](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/fo7p5b/introducing_reddit_polls_an_allnew_post_type/) had the consequence of exploding traffic in the existing subbie r/polls. In response, the community has been sprucing things up, adding new mods, and looking towards ways to grow in the future. If you’re stuck at home, drop by and take a few minutes to share your opinions. 


**r/Covid19Positive** 

* For those who are presumed positive or have tested positive for Covid-19, this community provides a supportive space to share the hardships and difficulties of having the illness, as well as uplifting stories of recovery.

* r/Netflix recently hit [1 million subscribers](https://reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/p2pbeo/congrats_1_million_members_for_the_subreddit/). With well-enforced spoiler tag usage, the mod team at this community have created a safe place for their members to discuss all things related to Netflix. Head over to discuss your favorite Netflix show!


**r/animalsonreddit** 

* The mod team over at r/animalsonreddit have hosted a welcoming RPAN broadcast community related to… you guessed it, animals on Reddit! With a cool [Hall of Fame](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalsOnReddit/wiki/hall-of-fame?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=AnimalsOnReddit&utm_content=t5_32g3v), it’s no surprise that this community has gained over 300,000 subscribers. Thank you to the mod team for curating such a great space to watch animal-related broadcasts!


**r/marriage** 

* A wholesome community that doubles as a place for support for its now 400k members, we found ourselves smiling as we browsed through it. The mod team here inspires their members to keep r/marriage a safe place for all, and they even extend [a monthly invitation](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/pz9ifg/monthly_marriage_survey_post_for_october/) for researchers to ask for the community’s help on their projects. Well organized and friendly, we love seeing the many moderation strategies used here.

Welcome to the latest installment of our Snoosletter, where we’ll share some community highlights, announcements from the admins, and news about events that may interest you. We hope you fared well during Shark Week, whether you were trying to beat the heat in the water or spent your time chilling in another hemisphere.

Now that you’ve read two mentions of last month’s Shark Week and Sharkfest, let’s dive into the Community Spotlight ocean.
 
&nbsp;
_____

# **Community Spotlight**

**r/Sharks** 

*  We would be remiss if we didn’t kick off this spotlight by highlighting r/Sharks’ [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/sharks/comments/oj1iaq/im_paige_winter_shark_attack_survivor_turned/). The mod team looped in Paige Winters, a shark attack survivor, and Dr. Mike Heithaus, a marine ecologist, to answer the community’s questions about sharks and the experiences of both people. This community’s moderators hosted a lot of great shark-related content during the peak of Shark Week, but have no fear-- you can visit r/Sharks to digest jaw-some content year round.


**r/Stargazing** 

* Do you enjoy stargazing? Do you have plans to watch the upcoming peak of the [Perseid Meteor Shower](https://reddit.com/r/Stargazing/comments/oo6mwo/ny_what_part_of_the_sky_will_the_perseid_meteor/)? r/Stargazing is a community for people who are passionate about stars and space. The sole mod of the community does a great job of hosting a friendly community where stargazers of any level are welcome. Head on over-- you’ll be blinded by great information related to stargazing!


**r/ReadWithMe** 

* As National Book Lovers Day is on August 9th, we just had to spotlight r/ReadWithMe. The mod team at r/ReadWithMe have achieved phenomenal things since beginning their community a little over a year ago. In this community, you can listen to RPAN streamers read their books on a live broadcast. You can also listen to authors discuss their works in progress. Don’t forget to check out their [Hall of Fame](https://www.reddit.com/r/ReadWithMe/wiki/hall-of-fame?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=readwithme&utm_content=t5_2q0682) to view some of their greatest recorded streams.


**r/BookClub** 

* Another community centered around books has a mod team that schedules discussion threads related to Book Club activities. Thanks to the creativity and passion for books this mod team has, their community members are never without a place to discuss the books they’re reading.


**r/ffxiv** 

* r/ffxiv hit 500k subscribers last month. To celebrate their great accomplishment, their mod team [held a raffle for their many members](https://reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/o9kqre/rffxiv_has_reached_500k_subs_get_ready_to_raffle/). We want to congratulate this community on their great growth, and we wish them the best as they continue to give their members a great place to discuss one of their favorite games.


**r/YokaiWatch** 

* Another community celebrating a milestone is r/YokaiWatch - they recently celebrated their seventh year anniversary. To celebrate, the mod team updated the subreddit with a new banner, icon, and custom upvote and downvote buttons, and we think [the results look great!](https://www.reddit.com/r/yokaiwatch/) We wish this community a happy anniversary and hope their members enjoy the community for many more years to come.


**r/ASOIAF** 

* The mod team at r/ASOIAF hosted a fun event for their community members. The members were given [a chance to try and decipher](https:/reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/ojmup7/spoilers_twow_enhance_help_us_decipher_one_page/) an unseen page from The Winds of Winter, which was read by George R. R. Martin at the Tiff Bell Lightbox in Ontario, Canada. This serves as an example of a fun type of event we love to see mods host in their communities to cultivate excitement in their members.

# **In Memoriam**

The r/ExplainLikeImFive community recently learned that the founder of their community, u/bossgalaga, passed away. In his honor, they created [a remembrance post](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/otzyon/eli5_remembers_ubossgalaga/) for their members to remember his many contributions. We would recommend that you take a look at the post highlighting him and his accomplishments as he was an important part of ELI5’s history. We thank u/bossgalaga for all he did for Reddit - he will be sorely missed.

We wanted to let you know that we are experimenting with Online Status Indicators, which are part of an initiative intended to make Reddit feel more like a place where activity is happening in real-time vs having just happened in the past. Starting in March of this year, if your Online Status is set to “On,” other users will begin to see your Online Status Indicator as a green dot next to your user icon when you are online.  

Your Online Status Indicator will only be shown to users if (1) your toggle is set to “Online Status: On” and (2) you are online on our iOS app, Android app, or the Redesign website. Importantly, you remain in control and can turn this feature off at any time, by clicking on your user icon in the navigation bar and toggling “Off” your Online Status."

Hiya- To add a new mod, you have to go to the subreddit's ""moderators"" page and invite the new mod by username. You can then opt to drop off the mod list or stay on as the top mod.

>If you decide to hand over the sub, you should wait until the new mod has accepted the invitation to make sure the subreddit doesn’t end up unmoderated.

>If you would like, we can also take care of it, just let us know."

#**Community Spotlight**

**r/Cooking**

* Have questions about [the Turkey](https://i.redd.it/2rnko20zf8141.gif) you need to cook tomorrow? Or perhaps you need inspiration for [a vegetarian entree?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/dz80ly/vegetarian_thanksgiving_entr%C3%A9e/) Well, here’s something to be thankful for: The r/Cooking community and their mods are ready with answers for everyone, as they dutifully are every year. Drop by and [see what people have been asking](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/e0o40z/its_thanksgiving_prep_time_again_in_association/) in the lead-up to the big day.

Before we move on, here’s a cornucopia of other honorable mentions:

* r/LifeProTips served up a few life-saving pro tips, for [the birds themselves](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/e1xl8n/lpt_if_you_are_frying_a_turkey_this_week_turn_off/) and for people who are alone and [looking for a wholesome way to give back](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/e0r87u/lpt_alone_on_thanksgiving_find_a_soup_kitchen_or/). Speaking of which…

* r/HumansBeingBros has already seen some [holiday humanity](https://www.reddit.com/r/HumansBeingBros/comments/dykkda/those_three_ladies_ages_6584_helped_me_make_a/), inspiring other redditors to help out as well. But of course, if your holiday’s not so wholesome, there’s always…

* r/AmITheAsshole has offered a peaceful gathering place for everyone trying to gauge [who’s in the right](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/e1s01d/aita_for_prioritizing_my_dog_over_my_family/) for all those Thanksgiving arguments. 

**r/Watchmen**

* While Alan Moore fans were probably already enjoying the community, the release of the HBO series has caused an extreme jump in traffic for the long established subreddit, and the mods have done a great job showing they are up to the task. If you’re watching the show, drop by for the weekly discussion threads. [Just 3 more episodes to go!](https://i.redd.it/mui45m4pq8141.gif) 

**r/Sixers**

* When Ben Simmons [made this shot](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dzavvi/highlight_ben_simmons_with_the_corner_3/) last week, it kicked off [a ton of donations to the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia](https://reddit.com/r/sixers/comments/dzefui/rsixers_donates_a_couple_racks_to_charity_a/) from the r/Sixers community, thanks to [a promise](https://reddit.com/r/sixers/comments/dz9huu/if_ben_simmons_hits_a_3_pointer_tonight_against/) made by u/mikeb32. 

**r/Cinderblock**

* When a chonker kitty’s efforts to lose weight [went viral](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/dmlzcj/cinderblocks_first_time_on_the_treadmill_trying/) a few weeks ago, this community became the go-to ga-to community for sharing Cinderblock’s progress as well as commiserating with other parents of chonker pets, thanks to a shared name. Big props to u/azenne who graciously handed over the community, previously devoted to actual cinder blocks, with with [a perfect parting gift](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cinderblock/comments/dwa1qh/hi_rcinderblock_im_the_first_owner_of_this_sub_i/).

* At the end of October, we shared our first Reddit Security Report, which [you can read in full here](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/dp9nbg/reddit_security_report_october_30_2019/). 

* And on another serious note, we want to remind everyone of the resources available if you or someone in your community is struggling with mental health matters or are potentially at risk of serious self-harm or suicide. We recently reformatted our [Help Center articles](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/suicide-response) regarding serious self-harm and suicide to make them clearer and include links to additional resources. Also, know that if you yourself or a user on the site needs someone to talk to, you can text CHAT to 741741 to be connected with a trained crisis counselor from [Crisis Text Line](https://www.crisistextline.org/).

**Extra Life 2019**

We want to thank all the moderators and communities that participated in Extra Life, the 24-hour gaming marathon to help sick children. We’ve [come pretty far](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/38679087) since our early participation days and thanks to your efforts, we’ve raised close to $100,000! Special thanks r/LosAngeles for their stellar fundraising efforts (for the seventh year in a row!), everyone who [hung out with us on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/reddit/clip/ColorfulMagnificentEggRickroll) on game day, and those of your who gave out the [Extra Life Charity Award](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/dpqd0z/the_extra_life_charity_award_raise_awareness_for/). 

If you weren’t able to join in this year, you can still help sick kids by [donating at any time](https://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donordrive.team&teamID=44667).

**Zombie Subreddit Challenge**

We recently posted [an update](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/e1jyg8/a_reminder_rise_of_the_undead_subreddits_continues/) on our challenge for bringing inactive communities back to life, and we saw tons of enthusiasm in the comments from folks who entered and want to see their communities do well. Best of luck to all ye who entered there, and stay tuned for next month’s Snoosletter for the special trophy winner announcement. 

Speaking of bringing communities back from the dead... if you have a community you’ve struggled to get off the ground, whether you entered the challenge or not, here are a couple of quick refreshers on [growing your community](https://mods.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002538532-Growing-your-community) and why it’s important to [seed content](https://mods.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024255272-Seeding-content-for-a-new-community).

Hopefully, the impact was positive and didn’t hit too many of you with unpredictable rapid growth, but if it did, [there’s a Help article for that](https://mods.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019892391) (thanks to the mods who participate in r/ModSupport).

Now, on to the Community Spotlight to highlight s’more gems.

&nbsp;

#**Community Spotlight**

**r/CFB**

* Since 2013, the /r/CFB community has raised and donated an astounding [$86,000](https://i.redd.it/tp9z5mr2s4c21.gif) for good causes. In their 18th charitable drive, the community donated $6,000 in toys to Toys For Tots, as well as over $6,000 for children’s hospitals. [Check out this post](https://reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/a9fg77/rcfb_donates_over_12000_to_childrens_hospitals/) for details about the drive and photos of donations from the community. 


**r/photography**

* Mods in r/photography recently shared a lengthy and well received [“state of the sub”](https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/af8t5n/state_of_the_sub/) post in their community to acknowledge and address some recent issues. While laying down clear boundaries around communication, the post demonstrated transparency, a willingness to change, and thoughtful efforts to continue evolving the community. Not always easy things to do so kudos to the mod team!


**r/reddeadredemption**

* The mods of r/reddeadredemption took [a niche customization suggestion from a community member](https://reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption/comments/ah2ak3/upvotedownvote_dishonor_is_kinda_messed_up_as/) and brought that contribution to life by updating their up and downvote buttons. 

**r/Dinosaurs**

* This community got our attention during the holiday Snoosletter contest we held a couple of months ago. We were looking for horror stories, but one of the mods wrote in and had absolutely nothing but good things to share about their time moderating there: “From the posting of a five-year-old's crayon picture of a stegosaur they drew, to a full-on paleontologist posting photos from an exciting dig, it's all one group hug about how awesome dinosaurs are. Rawr!” It’s definitely worth [chonking out](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dinosaurs/comments/ai4y6v/a_b_s_o_l_u_t_e_u_n_i_t_s/).


**r/audiobooks**

* If you like listening to your literature, there’s a lot to love about r/audiobooks. The mods have great resources available for those new to audiobooks. Not only do you get regular updates on new releases and up-to-date threads discussing what you’re currently listening to, but they also have a lovely active group of audiobibliophiles who are excited to share their first-rate recommendations with everyone. If you’re looking for something new to listen to, grab those noise-canceling headphones and stop by this community.    

&nbsp;

Congratulations to mods of communities that hit [1,000,000 subscribers](https://i.redd.it/6cgewxajs7c21.gif) in the last month. We’ve included a few highlights below.

**A quick reminder:** *If you’d prefer not to get these Snoosletters in your inbox, just hit the “Block User” button under this message and rest easy tonight knowing that somewhere out there—in some small corner of this big blue marble we call Earth—the lacrimal gland of an admin's eye is softly secreting tears that fall, ever so gently, like the falling feathers of a bird's plumage in molting season, onto an old, worn-out keyboard, as they press a melancholy F of respect.*

It’s been a while since we’ve sent one of these Snoosletters out. Things have been [busy](https://i.redd.it/zwqkyshze2b51.gif).

#**Community Spotlight**


**r/pcgaming**

* In celebration of hitting 2 million subscribers, r/pcgaming [held a giveaway](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/hdpn0v/asus_x_rpcgaming_summer_giveaway/) that encouraged the community to share their funniest and most exciting memories of gaming. Congratulations on unlocking your latest achievement!


**r/modguide**

* If you’re looking for moderation guides that span many topics and dive deep, this mod team has done a great job of providing just that, with the team having [over 100 guides posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/modguide/comments/ha8y3w/100_guides_posted/) so far. And if you’re just a super mod and want to help develop more guides, reach out to them. They’re also looking for more artists to help provide mod teams with much needed graphics in their community, r/BannerRequest. So, if you have skills, consider dropping by and helping out!


**r/fightsticks**

* The mods of this community, dedicated to a shared love for all kinds of custom and modified arcade like video game controllers, have done an amazing job of growing the community over the last year. [Check out this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/fightsticks/comments/hpla61/faq_and_fightstick_question_megathread_continued/) if you’d like to learn more about the world of fightsticks.


**r/eden** 

* r/eden, a fan community for the musical artist of the same name, [held a raffle](https://www.reddit.com/r/eden/comments/gtk3rc/eden_raffle_for_archive_merch_and_signed_items/) that [raised $1300](https://www.reddit.com/r/eden/comments/gxf241/update_raffle_winners/) to help support Black Visions Collective and Reclaim the Block, Minneapolis organizations active in the Black Lives Matter movement.

**r/migraine** 

* The supportive and occasionally meme-filled community for migraine sufferers got a fun [shout-out from Vice](https://www.reddit.com/r/migraine/comments/hpq48i/we_made_it_to_the_official_vice_instagram/) recently. As a fellow sufferer, keep up the good work, mods! [Check out the whole article here](https://www.vice.com/en_asia/article/7kpwzy/migraine-subreddit-memes).

**r/popheads** 

* The mods of r/popheads put out [a fun and informative subscriber census](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/hb1mqa/rpopheads_150k_subscriber_census_results/), proving that all roads lead to people playing Animal Crossing. And a lot of other cool data as well!

#**Thank You**

Remember a few months ago when we were planning to meet many of you - right around now-ish - as part of our annual Moderator “Thank You” Roadshows? Mmm. Simpler times. But as we’ve had to cancel those due to coronavirus, we wanted to find another way to show you that there are real people at Reddit that see you, are thinking of you, and are genuinely thankful for everything you contribute to the site and your communities.

2020 has been the longest decade ever. Some of you and some of your community members are probably experiencing a lot of extra stress and anxiety from having to shelter in place, amongst many other related stressors. And trying to moderate on top of it with all of that impacting you and your communities? It’s undoubtedly very challenging. 

So, we at Reddit would like to humbly and modestly send you a small token of appreciation: a one-year Calm subscription. It’s an app for everyday meditation, intended to promote mindfulness, reduce stress, ease anxiety, and more. No, this is not a tech-y promotional freebie or sponsorship; we’re gifting this to you because Reddit wouldn’t be Reddit without you, and we truly want you to be well. 

So! If you would like to sign up, please fill out your information [by following this link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdoPvt-uNJrG1a2A6ySx5qSintHveOdF6UfTnLbsjMmYSk9Bw/viewform?usp=sf_link). Subscriptions will be given out on a first-come, first-served basis to verified moderators. Once we run out of subscriptions, you will no longer be able to sign up. To sign up, you'll need to share your name, email, Reddit username, and the communities you moderate. Your name and email will be sent to Calm and used for the sole purpose of sending you this gift. Your information will be deleted after all memberships are distributed (unless you sign up for the membership, of course). Your information will not be shared or used for any other purpose. 

On behalf of everyone at Reddit, thank you for being there for your community, now and throughout the year.

Now, let’s move on to important policy updates.

&nbsp;


_____


#**Upcoming Policy AMA**

As you’re probably aware, we recently rolled out [an update to our content policy](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/hi3oht/update_to_our_content_policy/) which explicitly disallows promotion of hate on Reddit. It’s been a few weeks since the roll-out, and we want to check in with you and see what questions you have around enforcement of this new policy. To do that, we’re holding an AMA in r/modnews with our General Counsel, u/traceroo, on **Monday, July 20, starting at 9:30am Pacific**. 

We will be focusing only on questions from moderators that pertain to the new policy. We will not be taking requests for ban appeals or questions on whether we’ve considered action against other subreddits. The goal here is to answer questions around enforcement and how you see this policy being applied in your own communities. 

We’re really looking forward to being able to talk to you directly about this policy and what it entails. If successful, we hope this becomes the first in a series of AMAs about our policies.

&nbsp;

* We’re [testing new rate limits](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/hf4tx0/testing_new_rate_limits_for_modmail_and_private/) for modmails and PMs. 


* There’s currently an experiment running with [karma and awards](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/hmd17x/karma_experiment/).

I wanted to ask your permission before shameless pan handling for donations in one of my *favorite* subreddits. Seriously, I've been a long time lurker, but I think this might be the summer that ends!

Anyways, if you haven't heard of Bike and Build I'll give you the short of it. People, mostly students, raise money for affordable housing during the school year, and then bike across the country building houses in the specific affordable housing projects we donate the raised money to.

Myself, and two other friends will be riding together. As such, I'm sure that this journey will be full of romance, adventure, and *danger*. Such *danger*. As part of the shameless begging campaign I plan on throwing here I would like to keep my constituents updated on said adventure and *danger*. As a way of saying thank you, and helping to raise awareness of the two issues Bike and Build campaigns for. I admit, it's mostly an affordable housing scheme, but there will definitely be a lot of cyclist advocacy along the way. Not to mention great views, Ameri-can-do, and did I say, *danger*?

Anyways, if you've read this far it probably means you're interested. I'm not exactly sure how I can run a consistently interesting campaign during the year, but I think an AMA with myself and my friends might be fun. We know plenty of B&B alumni, so it might be really cool to have their inputs as well. Other than that, I've seen a few other sub-reddits sponsor a charity in their side bar. I think that could be awesome.

Please let me know if you have *any* thoughts on this."

My team and I were wondering if you received our last message and if you had time to take a look at the questions we had for you?

These questions serve an exploratory purpose and help us gage the typical usage and perception of the /r/bicycling subreddit by its users. They also serve as a complement to the quantitive analysis we do on posts and their subsequent comments by redditors. 

Since the question portion of our exploratory research plays such an important role to the overall study, we are waiting on the answers in order to proceed to the study’s next steps. An answers in the next couple of days would be greatly appreciated in order to advance in a timely fashion (our turn in deadline is in a little less than two weeks).

Also, if it would be easier for you to answer by alternative means (Skype, phone or other), we would be more than happy to oblige.

If ever you have questions, it will be our pleasure to answer them.

Hoping we hear from you soon!

Dimitri (and the rest of the research team)

I was on IRC today, and was talking to rara about trainers in so-cal, then he mentioned shaving legs because we talked about it earlier in the week (playfully mocked me about it), and I replied with ""/me punches rara for mocking him"". Few seconds later, Helicomatic told me that punching irc members is not allowed, and banned me from the channel. Not sure what's up with him, but he seems to hate me. He's told me before to leave because jedrek argued my political beliefs, which wasn't much of a problem since I just muted him and moved on. Ever since then, he's been kind of a douche to me. 

Not really sure what happened, but yeah. Hopefully you understand and unban me, since I love talking to a lot of the people on there.

Thanks,

We are a team of Masters students currently following a class called Consumption, Media and Participatory Culture. One of the main assignments of this class is to do netnographic research (ethnographic research of an online community) on a web based culture and essentially study the following aspects: what is a redditor’s motivations to participate, how do they get involved in the discussion, what are the shared interests and values of the members, etc. We are seeking your help for this research. 

Because Reddit as a whole is a very large field of study, we have decided to limit our study to a subreddit that we believe captures the essence of what Reddit represents as an online community. Engaging dialog, openness, interesting content and a true sense of community is what we picked up on in our preliminary search and that’s why we believe the /r/bicycling subreddit would be a great research subject. 

Seeing as how the nature of our research does not directly concern the subject of bicycling, we preferred to approach the moderators directly (transparency in our research is very important to us). It goes without saying that our research is purely academic and none of it will serve a financial purpose. Also, we are well aware of Reddit’s respect of anonymity and personal information will never be inquired about. 

What we would like to do, is possibly get the ball rolling by asking you, the moderators, a couple questions about your community, your role within it and how you see the community as a whole. We then, provided your approval, would like to interview between three to four members of the community to get their input as well. All of the interviews can be conducted either by e-mail, chat, skype, phone, etc. at your convenience. 

Your help and collaboration would be most appreciated. We look forward to talking to you soon. If ever you have any comments or questions, please feel free to ask.

Sincerely, 

CycleResearch2012
(On behalf of the team)

To me it is not about karma or up votes or any of that.  I never had any interaction of any kind with no_numbers but when he got hit the posts on r/bicycling were so depressing to me.  The post from his girl tore me apart.  Made me hug my kids.  

The reason I explain my feelings is to help understand how the driver who hit no_numbers must feel every day of his life.  I am not a religious person but I think forgiving people is important.  I get the vibe that many people on r/bicycling want blood because they were brought up in a society where its all about getting YOUR way and suing and getting lawyers until you are proven RIGHT! 

I had a friend who wife was hit and killed while jogging on a country road.  In our small town this was headline news.  My friend was quoted on TV and in the paper saying something to the effect of ""punishing the driver will accomplish nothing. He (the driver) has to live with the fact that he killed the love of my life for the rest of his life. I hope he can find peace""

This statement has stuck with me for a long time.  

thanks again,

Thank you for taking interest in our project! Your help and insights into the /r/bicycling community will surely be of great help to us in our research. We still have a couple things to refine on our end (final adjustments to the questions we would like to ask you), but we will be keeping you informed on our progress. 

Also, your documentary sounds really interesting! What are the aspects of Reddit that you are exploring (if it’s not too indiscreet)? After talking about it with my colleagues, we’d be happy to be interviewed! However, we are from Montréal so distance might be a challenge… We are really looking forward to working with you.

Sincerely, 

Dimitri (a.k.a CycleResearch2012)

Awesome! Thanks again for all you help. We would have one last question for you though. We would like to know if we could contact some members of /r/bicycling directly in order to get some of their input as well. We simply wanted to run it through a Mod in order to insure we're not committing a «faux pas». 

Good luck with your projects!

After contacting you earlier this week, my team and I have produced 8 questions we would like to ask you. They are general and non-directed and we believe this will produce more authentic answers and data of higher quality. This being said, the more detail you can put into them, the more data we get to analyze, so don’t be afraid to elaborate and go into detail. Depending on the answers given, we might contact you again with some follow-up questions in order to emphasize certain aspects. 

The questions are as follows:

•	Tell us about yourself - your work, your hobbies, your interests, etc.

•	How and why did you become a redditor?

•	What do you like about reddit?

•	Why do you follow the /r/bicycling subreddit?

•	What do you like in a post? And what do you dislike in a post?
 
•	What type of posts gets your attention and makes you vote or comment?

•	What is your perception of the typical redactor on /R/bicycling

•	According to you as a moderator, what type of post generates the most interaction between redditors

•	Are there any forms of informal rules within the r/bicycling community (e.g. rules not stated in the reddiquette) 

You can answer directly by IM or, for ease of use, by email at cycleresearch2012@gmail.com.

Also, we were wondering if you could possibly point us in the direction of /r/bicycle members that are highly active within the community. We would like to ask them questions similar to yours in order to get a good cross-section of users (moderators and users alike). This would allow us to take into account the differences between different user types. 

Once again, we are greatly thankful for your help with our research.

If ever you have any questions, please feel free to contact us.

Sincerely, 

Dimitri (and team)

So on that video link that I sent, my main interest in it was the way it documented the explosions in the basement level just before the planes struck and the signatures of explosive mechanisms in the floors above, especially nearing the time that the buildings fell. What's your take on all of this?

Once upon a time I resolved my doubts about the official story with a theory that if NYC officials were doing their job to protect the public generally they would anticipate a catastrophic WTC attack and securely pre-rig the buildings; in case they ever had to bring them straight down in order to avoid greater damage to surrounding people and structures. It's a unique take on it all but not unrealistic, and this would account for the flimsiness of the official investigations' findings.

But the fact that massive detonations took place in the sublevels of the towers (intended to be timed with the plane impacts) means something very different took place, and much more sinister than the Muslim Terrorists theory. "

But the problem with that theory is very glaring: Detonations were witnessed, felt, filmed, seismographed and audio-recorded that precede the impact of each respective plane. That is, moments before the planes had even struck their target bombs were detonated which filled the nearby Subway concourses with smoke, killed and mamed people, and devastated the WTC lobbies. This falsifies our wishful theory. "

I'm a silent lamb....
People could die, or at least that's what I've been taught.

I guess what I want to point out is that the WTS failed to protect the Children in the congregations and the Children in the hospitals. If you didn't read it he retired from children's hospital. 
He let children die before having a blood transfusion. If his faith was so strong, would he have assisted with non-witness surgeries that did use blood transfusions but deny it to his own flock?
Do you think he only molested children in the church? I doubt it.
Unfettered access to the drugs and the children. I cannot imagine that I'm the only one. What can a child testify to? if their predator has that much medical skill, is a skilled brainwasher, and the access to controlled substances. Plus with the hospital kids---they were ill, some died, others recovered, but if they remembered anything it could have been explained away as chemo side effects or anesthesia side effects.
I think this has far greater implications than I am willing to detail at this moment, for the safety of all involved. We can't have them destroying the evidence.

**""Every time I see an adult on a bicycle, I no longer despair for the future of the human race.""**           
H.G. Wells

For the life of me, I can't remember the names of more than 3 or 4 of my teachers.  If I was to look at old yearbooks, I be lucky if I could remember 40% of the kids I went to school with, and I'm not concerned about this at all.  See, I'm a firm believer that my brain has a limit to the amount of stuff it can store, probably about 4 gigs I think, and constantly stuff is pushed to make room for new experiences.  I'd like to think that I have a crack team of microscopic guys in lab coats working all the time, evaluating what must get deleted.  ""Hey Dave,"" the micro-scientist would scream, ""Looks like Johnny's got Coldplay tickets, go ahead and erase that creepy piano teacher memory just to be sure.""  Yes those little bastards work around the clock to make sure the good stays in and the bad gets gone.  For some reason, I can't remember names or where I put my damn car keys.  I can, however, remember every exact detail of each bicycle I've ever owned.

Growing up, a bicycle was everything.  It was my pirate ship to new adventures, my Ferrari that bombed down hills I would now consider unsafe at any speed.  It was freedom from the bonds that only young people can dream up. You want me to walk five minutes with my parents in the grocery store?  Impossible.  Ride all afternoon just to see how far or how fast I could go?  Absolutely, without question , when can we leave?

As a grown-up, currently reading at the 29 year old level, I take pride in my willingness to seek out challenges, explore new things and meet new people.  Every day I want to be better, and I want to learn and I want to go.  For all the things I am now, I thank my parents for they provided me with two wheels in my younger days. 


Today at Subreddit of the Day, we celebrate the two wheels good community, /r/bicycling.  This is one hell of a subreddit and you know it...  43,388 subscribers can't be wrong!!  Over 100 posts each day, tons of activity in the comment section, questions, answers, and oh how everyone loves the photos of your bike!  It's THE place for cycling enthusiasts, fanciers, racers and recreationalists.   Is it an unknown subreddit?  Hardly.  But I'm damn proud of my selection of /r/bicycling as today's featured subreddit because of one reason - the people.  The redditors who make this place good, the posters, commenters and moderators all believe in moving this place forward, growing and being the best online cycling community.  And because of your hard work, we salute all of you, we thank you and we recognize you as today's Subreddit of the Day!

Here to participate in an interview are the **entire** /r/bicycling mod team.  Many thanks to FountainsofDave, darkstar999, SoManyMinutes, aggieotis, stereo, and bicycling_community.  Harry, no_numbers_here, you are missed.  Although we never met, I dedicate this post to you and promise that the next time I see the sun I shall think of you, for you are the closest and the brightest star.  Shine on my good man, shine on.

>> /r/bicycling is todays SOTD because you help make reddit.com awesome.  Please explain to us how you feel /r/bicycling makes reddit better.

>/r/bicycling is a fairly large niche subreddit, which is quite unique. We welcome anyone who's interested in bicycles: whether you're thinking of [getting your first](http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/fa2w7/my_2yr_old_daughter_on_her_birthday_present_that/) or building your fifth bike, whether you cycle to [lose weight](http://redd.it/tos5p), to [commute](http://redd.it/ojatk), or just climb hills for fun, you can [get advice](http://redd.it/tep23), support, share the latest bicycling news, or just chat for fun. For immediate answers or to socialize, they can [join the chatroom](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#/r/bicycling) which is almost continuously active. We also collect local or thematic subreddits in our sidebar to have specialized discussions or meet other redditing cyclists in your area and organize group rides. We try our hardest to promote positivity and unity in bicycling and beyond.

>What are you most proud of when you think about /r/bicycling? What would you change?

>>We are most proud of our >43,000 contributors, commenters and subscribers. They do a great job of being friendly, helpful and putting a good face on bicycling in general. We created the chatroom in November to celebrate 25,000 subscribers and wouldn't have achieved such spectacular growth without our amazing community.

>>We're on our third run of reddit branded bicycling gear, organised by volunteers of the community. The statistics aren't available yet, but there are at least a thousand people riding their bikes across 20 different countries wearing [reddit cycling apparel](http://i.imgur.com/lbam1.jpg). They only go on sale once a year, so [sign up to be notified](https://groups.google.com/group/reddit-jersey-announce?pli=1)!

>>If there's something we'd change -- it'd be that people spend less time on /r/bicycling and more time on their bicycles. ;)

>I'd like to ask about Harry Delmolino, /u/no_numbers_here. Could you share a bit about Harry and how he contributed to /r/bicycling before his unexpected passing?

>>Harry Delmolino, known online as no_numbers_here, was one of our best contributors and moderators. [Harry passed away on Tuesday, May 22nd.](http://redd.it/u1rc3) due to injuries received in a bicycle accident. He loved to share his unique passion for bicycling with everyone in his life, and the community of /r/bicycling in particular, where he was a major contributor and moderator. Additionally, he created the reddit bicycling chatroom and helped it grow to an active real-time chat where people could seek advice and discussion about everything bicycle-related. Anyone who needed help with anything could always count on Harry's kindness, experience and patience. He inspired many with his love for cycling. We miss you, Harry.

I just had Internet access briefly last night. I'm still going to be more-or-less AWOL for several more weeks. Boy howdy I can see that things are in good hands though. Absolutely nice job with this IRC stuff. Love the idea, and also the idea leverage the 30,000 mark. (We're at 30,025 as of this writing, hey hey!)

I was trying to figure out yesterday how exactly to register for the channel when my (absolutely terrible) laptop battery died on me. Thanks for letting me know.

Unlike certain other moderator tasks, working with the sidebar actually doesn't require any CSS knowledge. (I barely know anything about it myself, but I slowly muddle my way through for the greater glory of bikeit...). All you have to do is scroll down to the 'ADMIN BOX' under the sidebar and click 'Community Settings.' Then you just edit the sidebar like a normal reddit post in the 'description' field. Don't forget to click 'Save Options' at the bottom of the page when you are done. I'd do it myself, but I'd rather let you phrase the listing however you want. Feel free to throw the IRC link at the top of the sidebar and/or in bold font or whatever you want.

Thanks for all your hard work and creativity. Rock on.

Anyone can create a subreddit and decide how it is run. If you disagree with how a subreddit is moderated, it’s good to first reach out to the team directly through moderator mail. Singling out moderators through reddit creates more drama than constructive change (reminder: posting personal information will not be tolerated). If you are unable to resolve your grievances with the current moderation team of a subreddit, the best response is often to create a competitor and see if the community follows you. In the rare cases of mismoderation, some of the most successful subreddits ever have cropped up overnight in response."

Sorry for the misunderstanding. As of Tuesday morning we had to close RSVPs since the event numbers are beyond the recommended double amount by SMW guidelines. There is no open bar option and all of the event has been donated except evian who is covering the staff.

*""Hi Brian,

I know you've been contacted a couple times regarding the NYC reddit community's (/r/nyc) interest in your event on Wednesday.

It seems that your camp has not fully weighed the ROI on our proposition. We want an open bar in exchange for us taking countless photos via Instagram and posting them all over the intertubes. So many tubes. 

At this time, as per Instagram's perceived slighting of the /r/nyc community, we have moved our Wednesday event (http://www.meetup.com/NYC-Redditors/events/52124092/)[please note the first and last(?) comments] to Slate NY. Also, we are in contact with your direct competitors in order to demonstrate our value as a trend setting online community. We will be sending our photos through one of your competitors, instead of through Instagram on Wednesday night. 

If your camp would like to reconsider your position regarding our guaranteed attendance now (Wednesday) or in the future, we're all ears. 

Best regards,

Forming your opinion on me: A lot of discussions go very deep and many are unrelated to the original discussion. If you took the time to research each particular discussion than I am not worried. I'm not that much of an asshole.

I definitely make a distinction between troll and asshole. A troll is just fucking with you for a response. An asshole is just your perspective of someone else because you do not agree with them. You were probably an asshole earlier. I'm not upset with you about it.

You inserted yourself in the middle of a conversation, like anyone can, and I offended you. If you want to play two roles wipe that part clean and put on the normal user hat. Your first comment to me was negative and disrespectful.

I would equate it to an undercover cop walking up to two guys in a light argument and then you said to one of them (me) what the fuck asshole? Where do you think you are?

I just quickly replied to you.

If you want to kick me out I won't argue with you but at the same time I would look into a few other posters also. I got your attention because I said something to you and did not back down. 

That's why we are still speaking now. But a lot of other people said a lot of other shit in the thread.

I saw that you were the main project managers and coordinators on the 2010 version of the jerseys and I was wondering if you could provide us with any insight as to what to look out for this year. Or what you would recommend doing this year instead.

As you might have seen, I've already kicked things off [in this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/fvlbw/2011_reddit_cycling_jerseys_lets_make_this_happen), but a little historical perspective would definitely be appreciated. 

* Who should I talk to for getting the sign-off from reddit for the design and such?
* Do they have a certain rate that they expect to see as a cut-back from the sale of the jerseys?
* Who do you send the proceeds to?

Seriously anything that you think would be beneficial would be most appreciated.

Thanks,

We've submitted designs, voted on them, refined them, gotten everything worked out with a vendor and are ready to roll...except.

Per the [licensing page](http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/licensing) for a project like this you're supposed to get reddit admin approval. I've tried contacting them going back almost 2 months, and have sent the final design to them to ask for approval, but nothing. Not a single response. Nothing. Ever.

So as a last ditch effort is there anything that you as the r/bicycling admin can do or would recommend us as a subreddit doing to get the ball moving on  their end on this? Seriously, any ideas or anything would be really appreciated.

I think it's safe to say that everything we've done is above board, the product(s) doesn't conflict with any of their offerings, it's a one-time  gig for people in our subreddit, not a store, and nobody is making  a profit on this. So I don't really get what the delay is.

**tl;dr** Any help or advice you can give in getting reddit admin approval of the 2011 Reddit Cycling Jerseys would be greatly appreciated by myself and many others.

Thanks for contacting us.

I've been involved in a few reddit voting initiatives in a community with a couple hundred thousand users. The idea, as mentioned above, is to avoid gaming of the voting system by submitters who have huge social media followings. We want the best content to win -- not person who has the most grandmothers who have nothing better to do than refresh and vote for their grandson all day, right?

The way that we got around than was to implement a system of voting called [**ranked  pairs**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_pairs) and it worked perfectly.

It'll take a little work to set up the front-facing voting system and the back-end database to record the votes but I know exactly how to do it.

I'm the senior moderator of /r/bicycling and a civil liberties/human rights law student.

I'm solely responsible for the following articles to make the news (I'm surprised you didn't contact me or mention me in your article). As, again, I am the main player in making an issue out of this.

I am Ryan Potts as cited in this linked article: http://www.dailydot.com/news/reddit-andrew-colton-boca-news-now-bicycling/

Your article for reference: https://popehat.com/2013/09/14/andrew-colton-and-boca-news-now-get-in-the-business-of-smearing-their-own-credibility/
I spoke with Andrew Colton on the phone and he threatened to sue me if I didn't take down the reddit comments exposing his practice. I, essentially, told him to bring it on.

He then proceeded to escalate the situation to reddit's legal team and they told him the exact same thing that I told him.

This said, as a law student, I would love to have a chat with you and pick your brain about this. It's fascinating to me on several levels.

Thank you in advance and I look forward to speaking with you,

2zeuxy,https://www.reddit.com/message/messages/2zeuxy,2zeuxy,2015-02-11 22:11:44 UTC,,SoManyMinutes,/u/NotADocta,Poker business.,">how much to charge for this service and if I wanted to expand, yes - income in remote locations.

This is where it gets *really* tricky as it **entirely** depends on your market.

I'll try to make this answer as concise as possible. Here we go:

How much do your dealers expect to make as a base fee for how many hours? How far are they traveling? Are they personally carrying chips, cards or felt to the event? Are they driving from out of state or are they taking the subway while carrying a table top and a case of chips?

Again, this is where the business gets tricky.

You have to pay your employees enough to where they're excited about working for you, will do a *great* job and look forward to doing it again.

You have to balance that with how much the client might be willing to pay with all of these factors -- while you ensure that **you** (the business owner) make a worthwhile profit.

My rule of thumb is to charge the client double my operating costs. I'll expand on this:

I hire one dealer for an event. Dealers at market value at $100 for four (4) hours. That's $25/hr (minus tips). I pay pay **my** dealers $120 for a hour hour shift. This way, as mentioned previously, I ensure that I get the best dealers. They want to work for me because 1) I pay them more money, and 2) They know that my clients are rich professionals who have tons of money to spend and will tip my dealers well. (This goes back to the SEO explanation in the previous comment).

________

So, if a client calls me and wants two dealers ($120*2=$240) and wants said dealers to bring one (1) case of chips/cards per dealer ($30*2=$60) -- then I'm out of pocket $300, right?

I charge the client $600. I take a 50% profit.

Either the client mails me a check (I live in Oklahoma City and run this business, remotely, for clients in the NYC area) or I have the client write the full check amount to my dealer on site and the dealer writes and mails me a check for the discussed and agreed upon amount of the overage.

TL;DR: This isn't a business which can be built overnight -- unless you are much *much* better at than me at SEO and making friends with dealers than am I.

I'll try to answer the first one first (it'll probably intro answers to your other questions as well, somewhat).

I'll start with the 'table providing' question:

Though, providing tables is *not* out of my range -- I try my best to shy away from it, and alternatively, have customers use their dining/living room table instead. There are several reasons for this and I'll try to outline the main factors in as few characters as possible. This could get very, very long -- and I'm currently on mobile.

The area in the US where my business obtains its customers is the most densely populated, least storage space, most densely populated city in the US.

There's no possible way that that any of my dealers can (or will be willing to) carry an entire poker table on the subway without me paying said dealer a *massive* increase in their pay.

Keep in mind that I'm trying to make as much money as possible with the last effort.

I don't want to worry about a dealer catching a bus while carrying poker table on a bus from Gross Point, MI to Detroit, MI when I can have a Manhattan hedge fund manager offer to pick my dealers up in a Lincoln at their homes and have them work a quick and easy job for a lot of money with no carried supplies


I research my clients and I know my dealers.

I know how much money I can charge my clients divided by how little I can pay my employees and keep them all happy -- while I take the biggest overage possible, of course.

________

I'll answer your (albeit, much more interesting question) later tomorrow.

'How do you get the business?'

SEO, to start. All of my business comes from people searching the internet for poker dealers to hire for the types of events in the NYC area which I outlined in the previous message.

Here is the main landing page: https://PokerPartyByRyan.wordpress.com

I also have several other pages and listings for the same business which bolster the SEO for the main page (linked above).

MORE IMPORTANTLY (and this will come later in your business development) -- CLIENT REFERRAL! The vast majority of my business comes from satisfied clients who recommend my company to their friends. 

*Poker players know other poker players!*

If you send competent and professional dealers to a client who they (and their guests) knows how to spot a competent and professional dealer -- then you have 9 prospective new clients at every table.


The **most important** thing, however, is the professionalism of your emails and phone calls with your prospective clients. Stong, confident and clear voice on the phone (Don't ever say ""Um..."") when you're thinking how to answer a client's question about a prospective event. **Know the business** so well that you always have an immediate answer for any possible question (""Can you bring us a big piece of felt when you arrive? We only have a conference room table in our office/dining table in our living room? Can you please bring some flowers in a vase as a center piece? [people ask for some really crazy shit]) to which a client could possibly fathom (we're poker dealers for fuck's sake -- not interior decorators -- but this is your job now [end tangent]) Your emails have to be **perfect**. Proof read them several times before sending. Here's why: The people who have the kind of money to pay for your service didn't come into that money by accident. They're smart people who have good jobs. They're already skeptical of hiring a *poker dealer* business from the internet who will come into their home with their wife, kids, bosses, coworkers and friends. You **must* be more professional in your communication via phone, email or in person than all of the aforementioned people combined.

To sum up this answer: I haven't updated the above linked website in years and I let my domain name payment lapse in as long. People still, somehow, find it with a google search. SEO is the way to start. Doing perfect business is the way to get more business. 

I'll answer your next question in my next message."

Phase refrain from engaging users of standupshots in the public forum with anything other than professionalism. Being a mod of a community this size requires an inordinate amount of self control and an incredibly thick skin.

If you're not capable of being a bigger man than the petty keyboard warrior detractors then I will promptly remove you as a mod.

I worked as a poker dealer in the NYC area for several years. I dealt for private event companies like the one I currently own (birthday parties, bachelor parties, bar-mitsvahs, corporate events, non-profit fundraisers, etc.) and underground (illegal) poker rooms.

As such, I met a LOT of poker dealers over the years and became friends with some of them. Some of those friendships lasted to this day. Some of them didn't.

I hire the dealers with whom I'm still friends. As such, I know that they're going to show up to the job on time, that they'll look good (showered, shaved, tuxedo pressed, etc.) they'll be personable to my client -- and most importantly, that they'll deal a perfect game. No mistakes.

I'll move on to the next question in the following message.

My name is Ryan. I'm an OKC native who has lived in NYC for the past fifteen years and has recently moved back to OKC after finding that I love it here. 

I mod several large (and small) reddit communities. Some of which I created and grew and some of which I was asked to mod and expand for various reasons.

You're doing great work with /r/OKC and I see a lot of room to expand and have some great things happen.

Would you like to kick around some ideas at your convenience to help /r/OKC grow?

/u/Wiggee and I have been working on the aesthetics of the [/r/bicycling Twitter account.](https://twitter.com/redditbicycling) in order to flesh out the /r/bicycling platform.

Up until now, I have been the sole content provider for the account. We previously had a command in IRC where anyone could post whatever they want as @redditbicycling. We have removed that feature as it poses more and more of a liability as the community grows. 

Every few days, I run a 'Google news' search for ""bicycling"" and I post the most up to date and valuable links regarding all things bicycling -- without going overboard. 

I also have 'followed' many (about 200) relevant cycling related Twitter feeds -- from pro riders to manufacturers to local advocates. I often 'retweet' these people if their content is interesting. 

If you all would like to help out with manning our account -- by all means, feel free.

me: I have no idea. Can you send me a screenshot? I know that's a pain the ass.

I did the first two orders of the reddit bicycling apparel. I know a thing or two about that process. Finding artists, dealing with community backlash, getting everything cleared through legal, etc. 

You did a great job. 

Like /u/darkstar999 said -- You can't please everybody. Especially redditors... who are also cyclists... who might lack a sense of design or fashion. 

I think the final designs were perfectly fine. Much better than the user submitted designs.

This goes back to me saying, ""People need to be told what they want"" -- which I **know** is an unpopular position -- especially with /u/aggieotis.

I'm all about the hand-off moderation strategy on a day to day basis. That was my main mission when I first came on as a mod.

However, when it comes to a site-wide branded product  --  pure democracy doesn't work. There's too much time, money and liability involved to let the masses decide, willy nilly, by clicking an arrow or -- god forbid -- telling all of their friends in to vote for their design (or any other method of cheating the system).

I can go on for ages about how I think this process should work -- and I'm quite willing.

I'm sorry if it seems like I'm rambling. There are a lot of things to consider in order to do this properly. This happens to be one of my strong points. 

All of that said, **let me be very clear** -- /u/aggieotis did a very good job. The current apparel all looks great! I think there are some practices which could be streamlined.

Again -- Awesome job, /u/aggieotis!

Following is part of an email I received from Harry's mother upon her being notified by her daughter that Harry's username is indeed included in the final jersey design -- around the time when the verdict came down regarding the motorist with whom Harry collided. 

>And I have been thinking about establishing a Memorial Fund to be able to have some flexibility to establish an ongoing scholarship in Harry's name, in addition to other ways to honor him in the future. Do you have any ideas for fundraising to start it off? I did see this  https://fundrazr.com/campaigns/2OXZc  and wondering if this is the appropriate venue and time for this purpose as well. Thoughts?

I have been speaking to Harry's family in private (online and IRL) for months and I feel so stupid for not thinking that we should have transparently charged an overhead for the apparel orders to be donated to a fund in Harry's name as mentioned by his mother above. 

Since it's too late to charge an overhead -- can we put an optional field to donate on the apparel order page? And and make it *very* easy to see?

Next.

I'm already in contact with Jena to get either of these two static ads placed in our sidebar on a heavy rotation for free. This should happen within a few hours. 

http://www.wiggee.com/images/r13-6.png

http://www.wiggee.com/images/r13-7.png

There is a 300x250 version of this ad which is beautiful but apparently we can't use it because ""it's the same size as [reddit's] standard ads."" (which they can't sell to any media buyer with a brain ($20K min, not kidding) -- but I digress. 

AggieOtis: Can we include a field somewhere on the order page for an option to donate money to a fund for Harry? And make it  **ridiculously visible**?

There's a lot of push to make things reddit-generic. I don't really care too much either way. But if we can push an 'r/bicycling' onto the bibs instead of the jersey or tech-top, then I would definitely go that route.

You know that I did the first and second reddit jersey (and arm warmers) order, right? I know how this works and, again, I thank you for taking on the job.

>Did you not read the survey (or all related posts saying what we're even doing)?

I guess I didn't.

>Not enough leadership, what the fuck does that even mean? If you have an actual idea feel free to suggest it, but don't sit here and be a dickish Monday morning quarterback when you haven't taken a single step to actually help this process.

You have *zero clue* of what I do here. You're like a kid playing in the sandbox which my company sold to your parents and built. 99% of what I do as moderator isn't seen by anyone. That's the idea.

>At least Stereo is actively involved in the community, sure he made a mistake, but we addressed and corrected that. If you have a specific problem, please address it (like we did earlier in the week), but if you can't make a specific, then don't make a blanket statement about 'being bad'. That's the kind of crap that lousy parents do to their children.

Again, you have *no idea* what I do here because *you* are not actively involved in day-to-day moderator concerns. Don't tell me that I'm not clued in. Stereo and I have had countless *lengthy* discussions about the direction of the channel via IRC. I don't remember you, aggieotis, being present for any of said discussions. 

>So we're supposed to say, ""Hey, let's come up with designs!"" I picked the colors, the shapes, the number of items that can be used, and where, and blah. All you get to do is decide do you want Snoo on the breast or on the back pocket.

Now you're starting to piss me off. You know very well what I meant. Provide the users with direction, amicably. If you need to me to write some words to explain this to the community, I'll be happy to do so. Just let me know. 

>I think your whole diatribe was an emotional rant, and would have been better just left in your head. Please don't criticize people unless you can provide some sort of constructive and applicable feedback.

Weird. I feel like *your* whole diatribe was an emotional rant. I feel like mine was fairly measured and straight up. Also, don't tell me about being constructive in this channel. I've constructed more for this channel than anyone else combined -- and that's a *fact*. Ask me about it if you want. 

> I actually don't think we should have an IRC channel at all. If the medium can't be tracked or traced in some manner, then it's useless to me.

This is where I became certain that you have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. Zero. None.

It's Ryan. We've met a couple times. Once in DC and then at the Dallas BBQ meetup with pool afterwards. 

I have been approached by a filmmaker with whom I recently worked (http://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/10ryeb/update_need_nyc_filmmakers_to_shoot_slenderman/) who is interested in making a proper documentary on reddit. 

This is what she wrote: 

>Specifically I want to explore:
The founding of reddit (goals, limitations, early struggles)
It's controversies (child porn? mention 4 chan) but also its charity stuff
It's early adoption by contributors (their demographic)
How it's become more mainstream (how demographic has changed)
But mainly, I want to analyze it's potentiality as a viral marketing goldmine for brands (to market virally) and also for artists (to self promote)
How does someone rise/fail in trying to market in that community (the science of a good post, the perfect algorithm)
also the interesting exploration of memes, its addictive nature, and the evolving state of social media and infotainment
It's evolving nature and speculation on its projection in the future (where is it going?)
Touch on how president Obama did an AMA. 
I would love to talk to social media experts and get their take on it, the founders or current staff (to get their views), long term contributors/lurkers, bizarro reddit characters, novelty accounts, and artists/brands that have used reddit to propel their marketing goals. 

We have several, shall we say, prominent reddit minds on board already. 

The idea is to make this *THE* reddit documentary film. This is a serious project and will take a long to time to develop and shoot. We're hoping for a June 2014 release. 

Is this something in which you would like to participate? We would like to have you on board to tell your story on camera.

Thanks for your patience and understanding. 

We all work hard to make this a fair and proper subreddit -- as such -- we're not perfect, clearly. 

I certainly would prefer that /u/aggieotis had not edited his warning posts (if what you say is true) and that will be addressed internally. However, that's not the issue here. 

The type of behavior you displayed is not welcome in /r/bicycling. Period. It doesn't matter what anyone else said. We'll deal with them, too. We're talking about **you** right now. You need to be the bigger man and conduct yourself in a civil manner.

You handled it wrong and you behaved inappropriately. Repeatedly. I don't care about edited warnings from /u/aggieotis. You shouldn't need warnings to tell you to not say the things you said in a friendly community.

**You** lost control and **you** got **yourself** banned. **You** behaved inappropriately and **you** couldn't stop **yourself**.

I hopes this helps to clarify.

***

1st. ""/r/bicycling is todays SOTD because you help make reddit.com awesome."" Please explain to us how you feel /r/bicycling makes reddit better.ooh, such a heavy question right outta the gate!


/r/bicycling is a fairly large niche subreddit, which is quite unique. We welcome anyone who's interested in bicycles: whether you're thinking of [getting your first](http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/fa2w7/my_2yr_old_daughter_on_her_birthday_present_that/) or building your fifth bike, whether you cycle to [lose weight](http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/tos5p/today_i_got_the_tool_for_my_weight_loss_200_kg/), to [commute](http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/ojatk/6_in_snowfall_2f_windchill_12_mi_commute_hell_yes/), or just climb hills for fun, you can [get advice](http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/tep23/customer_im_having_trouble_with_my_shifting/), support, share the latest bicycling news, or just chat for fun. For immediate answers or to socialize, they can [join the chatroom](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#/r/bicycling) which is almost continuously active. We also collect local or thematic subreddits in our sidebar to have specialized discussions or meet other redditing cyclists in your area and organize group rides. We try our hardest to promote positivity and unity in bicycling and beyond.



2nd. What are you most proud of when you think about /r/bicycling? What would you change? 


We are most proud of our >43,000 contributors, commenters and subscribers. They do a great job of being friendly, helpful and putting a good face on bicycling in general. We created the chatroom in November to celebrate 25,000 subscribers and wouldn't have achieved such spectacular growth without our amazing community.

We're on our third run of reddit branded bicycling gear, organised by volunteers of the community. The statistics aren't available yet, but there are at least a thousand people riding their bikes across 20 different countries wearing [reddit cycling apparel](http://i.imgur.com/lbam1.jpg). They only go on sale once a year, so [sign up to be notified](https://groups.google.com/group/reddit-jersey-announce)!

If there's something we'd change -- it'd be that people spend less time on /r/bicycling and more time on their bicycles. ;)



3rd. I'd like to ask about Harry Delmolino, /u/no_numbers_here. Could you share a bit about Harry and how he contributed to /r/bicycling before his unexpected passing?


Harry Delmolino, known online as no_numbers_here, was one of our best contributors and moderators. [Harry passed away on Tuesday, May 22nd.](http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/u1rc3/obituary_rbicycling_moderator_no_numbers_here_has/) due to injuries received in a bicycle accident. He loved to share his unique passion for bicycling with everyone in his life, and the community of /r/bicycling  in particular, where he was a major contributor and moderator.  Additionally, he created the reddit bicycling chatroom and helped it grow to an active real-time chat where people could seek advice and discussion about everything bicycle-related. Anyone who needed help with anything could always count on Harry's kindness, experience and  patience.  He inspired many with his love for cycling.  We miss you, Harry.



4th. Please, the floor is yours. 


Care to leave us with a parting thought or message?
Cycling is fun, /r/bicycling is fun. Ride on with us -- and SMILE!"

bl48o,https://www.reddit.com/message/messages/bl48o,bl48o,2012-06-03 21:47:37 UTC,,SoManyMinutes,/u/SRotD,/r/bicycling,"Hi Johnny,

Let's proceed with the below. We might have a couple tweaks later but this is basically it. Thanks again for the opportunity!

1st. ""/r/bicycling is todays SOTD because you help make reddit.com awesome."" Please explain to us how you feel /r/bicycling makes reddit better. ooh, such a heavy question right outta the gate!

/r/bicycling is fairly unique in that we're a niche subreddit but also fairly large. Anyone, regardless of experience level, reason for bicycling or type of bicycle they ride, can come to share the latest bicycling news, get advice, support or just chat for fun. If a user needs (or wants) an immediate answer to a question they, they can come into the /r/bicycling IRC channel (#/r/bicycling on freenode) where there will almost always be someone there to give them an answer in usually under a minute. We also collect local bicycling subreddits in our sidebar to help redditors meet other redditing cyclists in their area and organize group rides. We work try hard to promote positivity and unity in bicycling and beyond.

2nd. What are you most proud of when you think about /r/bicycling? What would you change?

I'm beyond proud that we're now on our third run of reddit branded bicycling gear. I don't have the statistics available to me right now, but I'd bet that there around a thousand people riding their bikes around 20 different countries wearing reddit cycling gear.

Additionally, we're proud of how quickly /r/bicycling has grown. We got a boost from this year's New Years Resolution reddit blog post. We celebrated our 25,000th subscription by developing the /r/bicycling chatroom which has taken off like a rocket and helped propel us to our current ~43,000 subscribers. We're also fumbling around with a new /r/bicycling Twitter account, @redditbicycling.

Last but not least, we're extremely proud of our contributors, commenters and subscribers. They do a great job of being friendly, helpful and putting a good face on bicycling in general.

If there's something we'd change -- it'd be that people spend less time on /r/bicycling and more time on their bicycles. ;)

3rd. I'd like to ask about Harry Delmolino, /u/no_numbers_here. Could you share a bit about Harry and how he contributed to /r/bicycling before his unexpected passing?

Harry Delmolino, known online as no_numbers_here, was one of our best contributors and moderators. Harry passed away on Tuesday, May 22nd. due to injuries received in a bicycle accident. He loved to share his unique passion for bicycling with everyone in his life, and the community of /r/bicycling in particular, where he was a major contributor and moderator. Additionally, he created the reddit bicycling chatroom and helped it grow to an active real-time chat where people could seek advice and discussion about everything bicycle-related. Anyone who needed help with anything could always count on Harry's kindness, experience and patience. He inspired many with his love for cycling. We miss you, Harry.

4th. Please, the floor is yours. Care to leave us with a parting thought or message?

Ride on -- and SMILE!"

/u/Stereo and I have been in touch with Harry's family. To what extent would take a while to explain. 

I met with Harry's sister, in person, for a couple hours over coffee in NYC earlier today. This was at Harry's mother's request as to put a face to /r/bicycling, and internet in general.  The meeting was extremely positive on both ends.

They (the family) want us (/r/bicycling) to brainstorm and figure out a way to do, primarily, one of two things in remembrance of Harry: 

1) Install a water fountain midway along the local community bicycle path. (This is what Harry wanted to do for his Eagle Scout project but the city council's red tape prevented him from doing it. With reddit's resources, I think we can make this happen). This was Harry's #1 wish. 

2) Harry's parents want to provide a waystation for cyclists traveling through their area -- which happens to be a major route for long distance cyclists. Harry's family owns the land and they want to install a water source, a sitting bench and possibly some tools for anyone to use -- along with a memorial plaque dedicating the site to Harry. Harry's family would like our advice on best practices in this regard.

For the record: /u/Stereo and I have been speaking to the family and dealing with their dynamics for quite some time now -- on their own accord. It's complicated.

Suggestions and comments are welcome as you're all mods here. As such, please keep it *here* for now.

Do we have access to the formatting of the copy on the apparel order page? If not, can we ask Primal to tweak it? I think the order, spacing and sizing of the copy can be improved.

Thanks so much for all the work you've done with this!

Thanks so much for your kind message. 

Yes, we'd be happy to be subbreddit of the day on Monday, June 4th. 

I appreciate the heads-up as to give us an opportunity to prepare. 

Also, I appreciate your acknowledgement of Harry (no_numbers_here). Clearly, that is something with which we're all dealing on different levels. I'd be more comfortable with addressing what Harry contributed to /r/bicycling that how it has changed since his passing. 

I'm just one mod here. The others might have a different take on it. 

Thanks again for being in touch. I'm looking forward to it. 

All the best,

Thanks again. 

We're ready and set to go on Monday, June 4th. 

The earlier you can send the questions, the better.

Regarding our reactions to Harry's passing... I'm sure we all handle it differently depending on our level of engagement with him. 

Speaking strictly for myself -- I tend to sob like an idiot every time someone who didn't know Harry asks me about him. So, hopefully that's a beginning to the answer of your question. 

We're looking forward to 'subreddit of the day' and we thank you again.
